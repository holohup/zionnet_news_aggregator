        "text": "World leaders united Saturday to condemn the attempt on ex-President Trump\u2019s life during a rally in Pennsylvania. Argentina\u2019s president Javier Milei threw his full support behind Trump, who he called the \u201cvictim of a COWARDLY assassination attempt.\u201d Milei also claimed that the shooting was part of a leftist agenda to keep Trump from securing another presidential term. \u201cThe desperation of the international left is not surprising, as today it sees its harmful ideology expire, and is willing to destabilize democracies and promote violence to screw itself into power,\u201d he wrote on X. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who had a rocky relationship with Trump, slammed the attack as \u201cpolitical violence.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m sickened by the shooting at former President Trump. It cannot be overstated \u2014 political violence is never acceptable. My thoughts are with former President Trump, those at the event, and all Americans,\u201d said Trudeau, who has had a rocky relationship with Trump, said on X. Sympathy for Trump also poured in from the US\u2019s southern border, with Mexican President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador calling the attack \u201cirrational and inhuman.\u201d Israel\u2019s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu \u2014 who once described Trump as \u201cthe greatest friend that Israel has ever had in the White House\u201d \u2014 said he and his wife were \u201cshocked by the apparent attack.\u201d \u201cWe pray for his safety and speedy recovery,\u201d Netanyahu said on X. Trump was hit in the ear by a bullet in the midst of giving remarks at a campaign stop in Butler. He was seen raising his hand to his right ear as nearly ten rounds of gunfire erupted before he was tackled to the ground by Secret Service agents. Other members of the service\u2019s counter-terrorism unit \u201cneutralized\u201d the would-be assassin, killing them, insiders told The Post. Sources said Trump came within \u201cinches of his life.\u201d American political leaders from both sides of the aisle \u2014 including those who butted heads with Trump in the past \u2014 expressed their disgust in the wake of the shooting. Michael Cohen, a one-time fixer for Trump who helped prosecutors secure the first-ever presidential conviction, criticized the extreme violence that left one audience member dead and another seriously injured. Follow The Post\u2019s latest stories on the assassination attempt against former President Donald Trump: Trump says he \u2018felt the bullet ripping through my skin\u2019 in first statement since assassination attempt Former President Trump \u2018inches away from having his face shot open\u2019 by assassin\u2019s bullet during Pa. rally; sniper killed: sources Gunman behind attempted assassination on Trump had head blown off by Secret Service, sources say; rally-goer killed Witnesses frantically tried to warn police of rifle-carrying sniper on roof before Trump assassination attempt Trump sees outpouring of support after assassination attempt at rally stop Keep up to date on updates with the Post\u2019s live blog on the assassination attempt on Trump \u201cWhether you agree or disagree with someone\u2019s political position, THIS IS NOT THE SOLUTION!\u201d Cohen, a star witness in the Stormy Daniels hush money trial, told The Post. Trump pollster John McLaughlin compared the near-miss to the March 30, 1981 assassination attempt on then-President Ronald Reagan. \u201cIt was a bad flashback,\u201d McLaughlin, who was a 25-year-old Reagan backer then, told The Post. \u201cYou can\u2019t take anything for granted,\u201d the pollster said. Like Reagan, Trump offered a signal to the audience that he had survived the initial assault. The bleeding 2024 presidential hopeful raised a fist to a cheering crowd before he was pushed into an SUV. \u201cReagan was shot. He survived and did well. He won re-election in a landslide,\u201d McLaughlin continued. \u201cWe pray that the boss is good and we go on from here.\u201d Dozens of Democrats \u2014 particularly those who have been outspoken against Trump in the past \u2014 offered their condolences for the injured politician Saturday. Former President Barack Obama, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries were among those who condemned the attack, the latter of who described the shooting as \u201cpolitical violence.\u201d",

The posts, including some written by U.S. politicians holding elected office, claimed without proof that President Joe Biden had ordered an apparent shooting at the rally. Others baselessly stated that the incident was staged, or circulated posts misidentifying the shooter. In the aftermath of major news, the facts of an event are not always immediately clear. Law enforcement, including the Secret Service, the FBI, Pennsylvania state police and the Justice Department have said they are continuing to investigate the shooting, including the possibility it was an assassination attempt.

On X, several politicians accused Biden or his campaign of being \u201cdirectly\u201d behind the apparent shooting, without providing evidence. Georgia Rep.

Vance, a top contender for Trump\u2019s vice-presidential running mate, wrote on X that the Biden campaign\u2019s rhetoric \u201cled directly to President Trump\u2019s attempted assassination.\u201d Texas Rep. Ronny Jackson pointed to unnamed figures on the left whom he accused of being \u201cdirectly responsible\u201d for the events at Trump\u2019s campaign rally. Collins, Vance and Jackson did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Their posts on X altogether garnered more than 7.3 million views on Saturday evening, according to data from the social media platform. As of late Saturday evening, the shooter\u2019s name had not been released to the public though NBC News said authorities have tentatively identified the man as approximately 20 years old and from Pennsylvania. Earlier posts on X, Telegram and Gab, forums favored by many on the far-right, misidentified the shooter as a man called Mark Violets, calling him a \u201cknown Antifa extremist\u201d that refers to the loosely organized leftist movement. According to NBC News, the misidentified person circulated in posts that included a photo was Marco Violi, an Italian YouTuber who has denied any involvement in the shooting. Immediately after the shooting, hundreds of thousands of posts reaching millions of views circulated on X claiming the shooting at the Pennsylvania rally was \u201cstaged,\u201d according to data from the social media platform \u2014 without offering any evidence. Despite being quickly debunked, many of the posts remained live on the platform. In the past year, content moderation efforts on major social media platforms have been weakened, as social media analysis tools have been shelved by Meta Platforms Inc. and others, and efforts from academic teams tracking misinformation, such as the Stanford Internet Observatory, have wound down.

        "text": "CAROLINA, Puerto Rico (AP) \u2014 Vianca Bra\u00f1a never used to attend basketball games in her hometown of Carolina, Puerto Rico \u2014 or anywhere else in the United States territory. But in recent years, the 23-year-old has left the arena with a hoarse voice, often wearing a T-shirt that reads \u201cCarola,\u201d a nickname for her town. \u201cWe started making this fun, and I wanted to represent the town where I\u2019m from,\u201d said Bra\u00f1a, who attended her first game the year Puerto Rican reggaeton star Bad Bunny bought a team in the island\u2019s professional men\u2019s basketball league. It was also around that time that she began placing bets on different teams across Puerto Rico with her girlfriends. Bra\u00f1a\u2019s fervor illustrates how Puerto Rico\u2019s professional men\u2019s basketball league is experiencing a revival, driven by reggaeton stars like Bad Bunny, Ozuna and Anuel AA, who are stepping into the financial game, buying local teams and helping to stack up a loyal fan base the island hasn\u2019t witnessed in over 40 years. What were once half-empty arenas in Puerto Rico are now packed, filled with families and young fans cheering for their favorite teams, from Los Capitanes de Arecibo in northern Puerto Rico to Los Leones de Ponce in the south. Attendance more than doubled from 2018 to 2023, skyrocketing from some 480,000 tickets sold to nearly 1 million, according to Puerto Rico\u2019s professional men\u2019s basketball league, whose digital presence has also soared in the past few years. A pivotal moment in the league\u2019s revival came in 2021, when three-time Grammy winner Bad Bunny became co-owner of Los Cangrejeros de Santurce, along with his manager, Noah Assad. Bad Bunny\u2019s frequent game-day visits sparked a resurgence in Puerto Rico\u2019s basketball scene. Other artists like Anuel AA quickly followed, buying Arecibo\u2019s Capitanes team before a new owner took over in 2023, and Ozuna acquiring Manat\u00ed\u2019s team, renaming it Los Osos, in 2022. The league, known as BSN, currently has 12 teams playing, compared with nine just four years ago. Basketball games have transformed into premier rendezvous events, attracting celebrities like NBA legend LeBron James, former boxer Floyd Mayweather and reggaeton artists including Arcangel and Rauw Alejandro, capturing audiences of all ages hoping to get a glimpse of them. \u201cWhen Noah and Bad Bunny came along, we generated a lot of noise,\u201d said Ricardo Dalmau, president of BSN. \u201cIt was an explosion of attention.\u201d Dalmau said local TV ratings also saw an upward tick after they began broadcasting some games in 2021, with the biggest surprise being their largest viewership block: women ages 18 to 49, a new audience that was also reflected in the bleachers. \u201cYou never know what artist you\u2019re going to find in the (league),\u201d he said. Before its recent surge in popularity, the league was under financial strain. Although Dalmau did not provide specific numbers, he said there used to be a lot of uncertainty about whether certain teams would participate or whether the league could fulfill players\u2019 contracts. \u201cWe don\u2019t have those problems anymore,\u201d he said. Javier Sabath, a popular basketball commentator on the island, said he is witnessing what his father \u2014 a sports commentator himself decades ago \u2014 describes as the environment in the 1980s, the heyday of the league. \u201cNew generations have never seen this before,\u201d Sabath said. \u201cThe boom with urban artists revived the Puerto Rican sports history that had been forgotten.\u201d Sabath said the momentum created by artists has fueled fans\u2019 excitement beyond just seeing reggaeton stars. \u201cIndirectly, these artists are attracting enough attention to make people interested in our league,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a domino effect.\u201d A bittersweet moment took place recently, when Puerto Rico national men\u2019s basketball team, composed of several of the league\u2019s star players, qualified for the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris. The victory over Lithuania broke a 20-year drought for the team that last competed in 2004, beating the USA team in the Athens Olympics. It is also a loss for the league\u2019s teams playing later in the summer. The league\u2019s renaissance comes after its peak over 40 years ago. Teams in Bayam\u00f3n, Quebradillas, Ponce and other towns had produced renowned players, including Butch Lee, the first Puerto Rican player to enter the National Basketball Association; Raymond Dalmau, whose son currently presides over the league; and Rub\u00e9n Rodr\u00edguez, who played for Los Vaqueros in Bayam\u00f3n. As part of the current frenzy, ex-NBA players have moved to Puerto Rico in recent years to join the league. Will Barton and Jared Sullinger play for San Juan\u2019s team, while other ex-NBA players like DeMarcus Cousins, Lance Stephenson and Brandon Knight also joined before moving on to other stints. Still, some problems remain beyond the league\u2019s control, including severe budget cuts, with the government slashing the island\u2019s sports and recreation department budget by more than half over the past decade. A lack of investment and maintenance in sports arenas across the island has caused leaks, leading to game suspensions after heavy rains. \u201cDespite the lack of economic resources, we\u2019ve been able to sort it out,\u201d said Ray Qui\u00f1ones, secretary of sports and recreation of Puerto Rico, whose infrastructure budget was cut from about $15,300 in 2014 to barely $7,500 in 2024. Sports arenas face the additional problem of chronic power outages across Puerto Rico, which is still rebuilding its electric grid after Hurricane Mar\u00eda, a Category 4 storm that razed the island in September 2017. In June, a game in Carolina between the home team, Los Gigantes, and Los Indios of Mayag\u00fcez was suspended after a widespread power outage left more than 340,000 customers without electricity. A month earlier, a game in San Juan\u2019s main arena was also suspended due to a power outage. Despite the challenges, younger generations are finding refuge outside their homes \u2014 which also contend with frequent power outages \u2014 and a new sense of pride by attending the games. For fans like Annais Ram\u00edrez, basketball arenas feel like safe spaces, especially for women looking to engage in historically male-dominated areas. \u201cThere are so many artists coming to the games, and you wonder if you\u2019ll run into one,\u201d the 27-year-old said as she stood next to her friend, who sported a necklace with a diamond-encrusted \u201cC\u201d for the town of Carolina. Her love for Carolina\u2019s team has grown beyond her expectation to run into a celebrity. During her free time, Ram\u00edrez goes on social media to catch up on the games she couldn\u2019t attend in person, checking out highlights, halftime performances and crowd reactions. \u201cThose motivate you to be part of the movement,\u201d she said. \u201cOn weekdays, this helps me unwind.\u201d ___ Follow AP\u2019s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america",

[+] during the UFC Fight Night event at Ball Arena on July 13, 2024 in Denver, Colorado. (Photo by Josh Hedges/Zuffa LLC via Getty Images) Zuffa LLC via Getty Images Rose Namajunas got the job done in the main event of UFC Denver on Saturday night at the Ball Arena. With Saturday's unanimous-decision win over Tracy Cortez, the former two-time strawweight champion has won two in a row at flyweight. Despite her strong performance and a display of her well-rounded game in the win, the future Hall-of-Famer, Rose Namajunas, was not among the bonus winners. Here is a list of the results from Saturday, July 13, in Denver, and the bonus winners from a night with a ton of finishes. Rose Namajunas defeats Tracy Cortez by unanimous decision (49-46, 49-46, 48-47) Muslim Salikhov defeats Santiago Ponzinibbio by split decision (28-29, 29-28, 29-28) Jean Silva defeats Drew Dober by TKO (doctor\u2019s stoppage) at 1:28 of Round 3 - FOTN Gabriel Bonfim defeats Ange Loosa by unanimous decision (30-27, 30-27, 29-28) Julian Erosa defeats Christian Rodriguez by submission (guillotine choke) at 4:49 of Round 1 Abdul Razak Alhassan and Cody Brundage ruled a No Contest (accidental blows) at 0:37 of Round 1 Charles Johnson defeats Joshua Van by knockout (right uppercut) at 0:20 of Round 3 - POTN Jasmine Jasudavicus defeats Fatima Kline by unanimous decision (30-27, 30-27, 30-27) Montel Jackson defeats Da\u2019Mon Blackshear by knockout (left hand) at 0:18 of Round 1 - POTN Luana Santos defeats Mariya Agapova by submission (rear-naked choke) at 3:27 of Round 1 Andre Petroski defeats Josh Fremd by unanimous decision (30-27, 30-27, 30-27) Evan Elder defeats Darrius Flowers by submission (arm-triangle choke) at 1:46 of Round 2 Forbes VettedFor You The Best Gaming Laptops Under $1,000: Boost Your Games For Less By Jon Martindale Contributor Bonus Winners DENVER, COLORADO - JULY 13: (L-R) Jean Silva of Brazil punches in a lightweight fight during the ... [+] UFC Fight Night event at Ball Arena on July 13, 2024 in Denver, Colorado. (Photo by Josh Hedges/Zuffa LLC via Getty Images) Zuffa LLC via Getty Images The UFC got it right with every $50,000 bonus they awarded in Denver. Dober and Silva put on the most spirited scrap of the evening on the main card. Silva\u2019s striking power and his chin were on full display. He opened a nasty gash over Dober\u2019s right eye with a spinning back elbow in the first round. The cut was worsened by the same strike in the third, which led to the Octagonside doctor calling an end to the Fight. It was a great fight and well worth the Fight of the Night bonus it received. Montel Jackson\u2019s power is pretty amazing. He scored the second-fastest finish in men\u2019s bantamweight history with his 18-second destruction of Da\u2019Mon Blackshear on the prelims. Take a look at this and take note of Dominick Cruz\u2019s timely call of the finish and the strike type. It was only 18 seconds of work, but well worth a bonus. Jackson has won five fights in a row and might be ranked in the Top 15 in the UFC\u2019s next update. Charles Johnson got the other bonus of the night for his third-round KO win over Joshua Van. Johnson increased his aggression in the third round in a close fight that he might have been losing on the scorecards. He landed a right cross that hurt Van, and Johnson followed it up with an uppercut from long range that led to the finish. Here is a look at Johnson\u2019s finish: Johnson is on a run, having won his last three contests. It was a strong night of fights in Denver as the UFC heads back to the Apex in Las Vegas for Saturday\u2019s card, a much smaller event with Amanda Lemos and Virna Jandiroba headlining.

        "text": "Sonic The Hedgehog is a beloved figure, lending his name to an abundance of games in the Sonic franchise, including crossover games such as Super Smash Bros. and Mario and Sonic. As such, it is no surprise that he has found his way into the realm of horror. Since the creepypasta \"SONIC.EXE\" was posted in 2011 by JC-the-Hyena \u2014 revolving around a cursed Sonic game in which Sonic is some kind of evil entity \u2014 Sonic horror games have steadily increased in popularity. Despite still being a relatively niche corner of the gaming world, many platforms are saturated with Sonic and Sonic.exe fan-games, and it can be difficult to distinguish which ones are trustworthy or even worth playing. The following are among the highest rated Sonic horror games that can be found on itch.io. 7 Sonic Shock Itch.io Score: 3 Developer: Haunted Bees Productions Sonic Shock is a role-playing horror-adventure game. Waking at \"Space Colony M0B1\" after being cryogenically frozen, the player must find mayhem rubies to find and defeat \"Doctor Roboton,\" who has turned everyone into robots. Quite unlike the games in the Sonic franchise, this one takes certain elements and remodels them into something entirely new. Considering it is made entirely from stock photos, Sonic Shock has a surprisingly retro feel and its own unique atmosphere. With shooter and stealth mechanics, and the option to upgrade abilities, this game is great for all kinds of gamers \u2014 not just horror fans. 6 Felix And Friends Itch.io Score: 4 Developer: Wrath of Wood In Felix and Friends, the player takes on the role of Felix the Cat, another familiar character from the cartoon world. After his home is broken into by \"The Copywriters,\" who have sent other famous figures after him for breaking copyright law, he flees. While not overtly gory or jump-scary, the familiar yet different character and environment designs are extremely uncanny. Traversing different levels of a Sonic-inspired platform world, players will come across a range of bosses, each modeled after familiar game and TV characters. After defeating these bosses (\"Soniku\" being the first they come across), the player can play as them. Overall, Felix and Friends is both comical and very self-aware, offering a well put-together experience that comments on the fan-game industry. 5 Sonic's School Day Itch.io Score: 4 Developer: MrScottyPieey Sonic's School Day is a first-person survival horror game. Harking back to the original SEGA educational game, Sonic's Schoolhouse, the player must navigate a maze of classrooms and hallways and escape a variety of different characters. With surreal environments, multiplayer mode, and math and spelling elements, this game is extremely unsettling. Players will never know what to expect when they turn a corner. Sonic's School Day also supports mods for gamers who enjoy customizing their games. 4 Sonic 1 Prototype Itch.io Score: 4 Developer: MosaicArts Sonic 1 Prototype begins relatively normally in the Green Hill Zone of the original Sonic the Hedgehog (1991). With familiar loops and ring collection, this game could be mistaken for any other Sonic game. However, there are some hints that all is not as it seems. As the player progresses through the acts, they may notice dead animals scattered about the landscape. During Act 3, the sky turns black, and the landscape becomes obscured by a static hue. Once the error pops up and the player is told to \"Leave Now,\" they can heed the warning or continue \u2014 at their own risk. 3 Executable Education Itch.io Score: 4.2 Developer: Shroudy Software Executable Education is a first-person horror game with three different levels. First, the player must find functional computers in their office to type words and remove the sonic.exe virus, while being stalked by a disturbingly dark version of Sonic. Once completed, they clip to a school where they must complete math tasks as a ruler-wielding Sonic hunts them down. Finally, they must monitor and fend off hostile Sonic robots via security cameras. Overall, Executable Education has diverse gameplay that draws on other familiar mechanics and environments while maintaining its own unique and horrific universe. 2 Five Nights At Sonic's Reimagined Itch.io Score: 5 Developer: Sanic As its title suggests, Five Nights at Sonic's Reimagined is a Sonic and Five Night's at Freddy's-inspired crossover. Taking on the night shift at SEGA Inc., the player must survive for five nights from 12am to 6am. It is not that simple, however, as the malfunctioning character performers that had been scrapped and locked away have now escaped. Five Nights at Sonic's Reimagined maintains a lot of the tension that the best Five Nights at Freddy's games are known for, but at the same time, this game deviates to take on its own aesthetic and lore. With a bonus 6th night, unlockable extras, and a custom nights mode, Five Nights at Sonic's Reimagined is both entertaining and immersive. 1 Another Sonic.exe Fan Game (2.0) Itch.io Score: 5 Developer: Pudim Abestado An upgraded sequel to the developer's previous game of the same name, Another Sonic.exe Fan Game (2.0) is worth checking out. Each playable character (Tails, Knuckles, and Doctor Robotnik) has their own level, with different objectives tailored to their lore in the original game series. Similarly, the characters have their own abilities that can help with the tasks; Tails can fly, Knuckles can punch, etc. They must complete the objectives in time or face the wrath of Sonic, who has his own evil agenda. This game is both challenging and fun, and it has a very dark atmosphere. It also has multiple endings, depending on the outcome of the different levels.",

        "text": "HoYoverse, mainly known as MiHoYo, have been developing games for otakus for more than a decade. In their journey of 10+ years they have released a variety of games. While the core theme of the games remains the same, revolving around cute female characters as the playable avatars, each game is vastly different from each other in many ways. MiHoYo has more than half a dozen games under their belt, and while most of these games do not belong in the same genre, a question arises nonetheless: Which game is the best? This list answers that question by ranking all the games by MiHoYo from worst to best. 9 Legend Of Saha The Beginning Of The Journey Having Legend of Saha on this list at all is a stretch, but the game deserves a spot as an honorable mention, as it kicks off a thrilling adventure for the founders of MiHoYo, the tech otakus who save the world. The game was originally supposed to be a part of a bigger game, but a flash game was made with only one character by Cai Haoyu in 2010 for a student competition. The game won some prizes in the competition, which acted as a stepping stone for the eventual founding of MiHoYo. Despite being a simple game where players are tasked with moving from one level to another dodging enemy attacks, it's rich with story, presented in the form of walls of text. Legend of Saha lays the foundation for the games eventually created by MiHoYo, and there is a chance that the story of Misei Nanatsuki, the main character of Legend of Saha, could be reused in . 8 FlyMe2theMoon Introducing The Poster Child Of MiHoYo is the game where the character Kiana Kaslana was brought to life, who further served as the poster child for MiHoYo. This game revolves around controlling Kiana, equipped with a jetpack, as she has to navigate through obstacles to try and reach the moon. The game featured plenty of levels to play and came with a soundtrack made with VOCALOID software named MoonTrip. The name of the game was inspired from the ending theme of Neon Genesis Evangelion, which also served as the basis for the game\u2019s concept. This 2D side scrolling game features different modes, like adventure, puzzle, racing and exploration. It is moderately challenging, and it keeps players engaged over the course of 60 levels. With a nice art style and skill-based gameplay, even if the game is rough in the controls department, FlyMe2theMoon is a good game that can keep players entertained hours. 7 Zombiegal Kawaii / Houkai Gakuen Even The Zombies Are Too Adorable To Shoot Moving on from FlyMe2theMoon, miHoYo takes a leap when they create , also known as . This side-scrolling shooter takes the players on a zombie killing spree inspired by the anime manga series Highschool of the Dead. The shoot-em-up style gameplay paired with adorable art and cute voice work keeps the atmosphere of the game light. Players control Kiana once again, as she fights against large hordes of deadly yet adorable zombies. While at times upgrades become a necessity to make progress, and players can either use real money or grind for a few hours to steadily make progress, it doesn\u2019t hinder the overall enjoyability of the game. The entire vibe of is fun and lighthearted, and with its simple gameplay, Zombiegal Kawaii attracted plenty of gaming otakus towards miHoYo. 6 Guns GirlZ / Houkai Gakuen 2 A Step Up From Its Predecessor Soon after the first Houkai Gakuen was released, miHoyo worked hard and fast to release the second installment in the series. This is the first time the developers stuck with the same gameplay style as their previous game. takes over from its predecessor while telling a comprehensive story for the first time in any of miHoYo's games. The narrative expands on the simple setting of its predecessor, as it depicts girls surviving the zombie apocalypse due to a Houkai phenomenon that occurs once in several centuries. GGZ makes gameplay more interesting by adding more characters and weapons, which can be further upgraded using in-game resources. An additional multiplayer mode is also available for players to play with friends. GGZ also introduces a Guild system, where multiple players can join a guild to access more opportunities for events and rewards. With a proper story that expands with frequent game updates, along with many other additional features, Gun GirlsZ turned out to be a financial success, forcing miHoYo to increase their team size if they wanted to grow further. 5 Tears Of Themis A Treat For Otome Fans miHoYo has always explored different genres when developing a new title. focused on a different side of otaku culture that was not yet explored by miHoyo. The game falls in the mystery romance genre, and almost plays itself via a visual novel format. With a self-insert character for players, the protagonist starts her journey as a rookie lawyer brimming with ambition and determined to help people. The story involves players solving various cases and getting involved with the four main potential love interests. The game has a variety of stuff to do, ranging from completing cases and progressing the story to collecting characters from the Gacha system and completing time-limited events to collect rewards. Tears of Themis takes ideas from other otome games and puts its own spin on them, thus creating something new while honoring the familiar elements of the genre. While the gameplay might not be everyone's cup of tea, Tears of Themis will be loved by otome fans and players looking for mysterious stories, compelling art, and bold romances. 4 Zenless Zone Zero The Latest Entry From HoYoverse Zenless Zone Zero is the latest HoYoverse endeavor in their grand journey of making games for the otakus. Pivoting from the fantasy setting of Genshin Impact and the space adventures of Honkai Star Rail, HoYoverse moves to make Zenless Zone Zero a game set in an urban dystopia. This action RPG is by far Hoyoverse\u2019s best work when it comes to fluid character animations and physics. Utilizing various characters in combat, parrying enemy attacks at the right time to trigger intro skills and performing various combos to defeat the enemies forms the core gameplay of ZZZ. Zenless Zone Zero has more style and esthetic excellence than any HoYoverse game. Instead of featuring a vast open world with a grand story where the players are up against the gods, the game takes a more grounded approach, as players experience the story of two tech enthusiast siblings and their day-to-day adventures in a retro dystopia. 3 Honkai Impact 3 The Game That Established miHoYo miHoYo have dabbled with a variety of projects since their formation, but it was with when they found immense success. HI3 represents the evolution of miHoYo from a niche Gacha game development company to one of the biggest powerhouses in the Gacha market. Taking a big gamble when developing the game, miHoYo\u2019s plan for their next game was a 3D action RPG Gacha, and with constant support for the game, they have righteously taken HI3 to another level. There are a ton of reasons to explain the popularity of the game back when it was released in 2016. From smooth animations and fluid gameplay to the adorable playable characters, Honkai Impact 3rd is a treat for the otakus. However, as that strong gameplay evolved with time, miHoYo also successfully created a compelling story with unique characters to keep players invested and, while the game is witnessing an end to its 7-year-long saga, it is still going strong with new content, characters, and gameplay to attract fans even after almost a decade. 2 Genshin Impact Making Gacha Games More Mainstream made waves in the gaming space when it was launched in 2020. The open world RPG appealed to a vast audience, and acted as a gateway for players who were strangers to Gacha games. miHoYo has always been focusing on new things and, with Genshin Impact, their newfound focus was on creating a breathtaking open world full of diversity came to life when they created the beautiful world of Teyvat. The boundless world of Teyvat is divided into 7 unique nations, and each part of Teyvat offers a plethora of activities for players to take on. From exploring the beautiful world of the game to fighting monsters and bosses, collecting loot and new characters, and then upgrading them for use in combat, there is no end in sight in terms of content offered. The combat in the game is also unique, as it creates its own elemental reaction system, and players have to use a mixture of various elements in battle efficiently and string together some serious combos. By creating a game that appeals to casual players who like to explore the world and immerse themselves in the lore of a game, and to the hardcore ones who like to build teams and characters to fight enemies as effectively as possible, this Breath of the Wild-inspired game is something special, making it one of the best HoYoverse games ever made. 1 Honkai: Star Rail Going On A Majestic Interstellar Journey After spending many years creating action RPGs, miHoYo moved on to try something different, and began the creation of . This turn-based RPG is by far miHoYo\u2019s best game, as it learns from the mistakes of the previous games and creates something engaging and entertaining. miHoYo always had a reputation for creating intricate stories, and Honkai: Star Rail lives up to their reputation. Playing as an amnesiac protagonist, the players embark on a space odyssey, visiting different planets, meeting new characters, and unraveling the mystery behind their origins. The gameplay takes the Gacha elements of the game into consideration, and creates a style that is suited to both possible scenarios: Manual battles where players have to carefully strategize, and an auto-battle option to grind stages quickly and effectively to level characters up. Apart from this, the game features a big area to explore while playing the story, filled with surprises to discover. The worlds in Star Rail are lively, and players can interact with everything, even random objects, which is an amusing little detail. Fun interactions, quirky dialogue, and pop culture references are commonly found in Star Rail, and they balance well with the darker themes of the game, like loss, injustice, and suffering. Paying attention to little details and learning from past mistakes, HoYoverse has created its best RPG yet. Star Rail offers dozens of hours of gameplay to keep players engaged, and with more content to come, that will only increase. It also features extremely player-friendly support for a Gacha game, which makes Honkai: Star Rail by far the best game created by miHoYo.",

        "text": "It\u2019s a beautiful day in Essex and I\u2019m making myself at home with the Dyers. Theirs is a neat house on a hill, furnished in white and grey with a vast marble kitchen island and a bulldog called Debbie. And, no offence, but my God Debbie is large. The width and girth of a coffee table, she lumbers affectionately across the tiles towards Jo, Dyer\u2019s partner of more than 30 years, elegant in white as she mourns a missing T-shirt, and their teenage daughter Sunnie, who sweeps through to grab a bottle of water on her way to college. Artie, who\u2019s 10, is at school and their eldest daughter, Dani, is in Germany with her three children, aged three and under, there to support her footballer boyfriend Jarrod Bowen at the Euros. Builders sweat on the patio outside, the sun glints off shelves of awards. And there, in the middle of it all, grinning into a tiny coffee, is Dyer, calling everyone baby. Dyer, Debbie and I stand in the awards alcove and with his pointing finger he takes me on a swift tour of his career. \u201cI\u2019ve nicked a few awards over the years I suppose,\u201d he smiles. \u201cI did really well, I can\u2019t believe that.\u201d There are National Television Awards won over his nine years on EastEnders, one of which he dedicated, in a choked acceptance speech, to his mentor Harold Pinter and children living in poverty, then there\u2019s a framed photo of Pinter and an Attitude award he won for being a \u201cstraight ally\u201d for his first soap storyline. He\u2019s proud of that one. \u201cI remember when they approached me about EastEnders and I thought, obviously I\u2019m going to be coming in as a gangster or something like that. Alpha male, working class, anti-gay.\u201d Then they said his first storyline would involve his son coming out to him. \u201cThey created this character for me who was an alpha male, but who wore a pink dressing gown. Somebody that is very protective, can swing a right hander, but will open up about his feelings.\u201d The dog gives me a pointed look, as if to check I can tell he\u2019s talking about himself. to be the year of Danny Dyer. As well as his TV comedy debut, in Ryan Sampson\u2019s Mr Bigstuff on Sky, he\u2019s starring in Disney\u2019s glossy new adaptation of Jilly Cooper\u2019s Rivals (\u201cWait until you see Danny,\u201d co-star David Tennant said, \u201cHe\u2019s brilliant.\u201d) and a film about football hooliganism called Marching Powder. Today he\u2019s wearing a large gold watch that glitters as he sips his coffee \u2013 in front of him now on the impossibly tidy kitchen counter are a baby\u2019s dummy and white dice, into which I idly read some light symbolism. His family have left the room and he marvels briefly. \u201cMe and Jo have been together since we were 13. Which just doesn\u2019t happen, does it, now? It\u2019s fascinating to me, still. When I look at her, part of me sees her back then, but then I also look at the pair of us and go, \u2018Wow, we\u2019re grandparents now.\u2019 It\u2019s been a mad old journey.\u201d They grew up on the same council estate in east London, where, when Dyer was nine years old, his father left them for his other, secret family. Dyer\u2019s reaction was rage; he was in constant trouble until his drama teacher enrolled him in a Saturday club where he was spotted by an agent and, at 16, cast in Prime Suspect. He and Jo had Dani two years later. \u201cI remember on Twitter someone said, \u2018The most Danny Dyer thing Danny Dyer\u2019s ever done is calling his kid Dani Dyer,\u2019\u201d Dyer says, wrinkling his nose, \u201cAnd I thought, \u2018What the fuck does that even mean?\u2019\u201d It\u2019s just what you do, he mumbles; you name your kid after yourself. He laughs. When she won Love Island in 2018, \u201cAll of a sudden, I was the second most famous Danny Dyer in the country.\u201d Why did he roll his eyes at the idea of EastEnders casting him as a gangster? \u201cI think I\u2019m falling into the category where people either respect me as an actor or they think that I play myself. So that\u2019s been a running theme throughout my life.\u201d He muses for a second. \u201cThere\u2019s an element of classism in it, because I speak in a cockney accent. But I think my mistake was that I\u2019ve probably done too many documentaries [like Danny Dyer\u2019s Deadliest Men, or I Believe in UFOs] and revealed too much about myself as a human being. Because as actors our toolbox is us. If you give away all your stuff, then people watch you and go, \u2018Oh he\u2019s just playing himself.\u2019 But that\u2019s what acting is. We\u2019re salespeople. Do you believe it? Do you buy it? Do you give a fuck about what I\u2019m talking about? It\u2019s not about whether you can do hundreds of accents. In my eyes, it\u2019s like, do you believe what I\u2019m saying? Do you care? And so you have to dig within.\u201d On the other hand, it\u2019s been these documentaries that have brought him a lot of fans, and fame. \u201cI divide opinion, but I think that\u2019s fine. I struggled with it as a younger actor and when social media first came around. But I\u2019m absolutely fine with it now.\u201d The struggle, back then, was well documented in the tabloids. There were cheating scandals and drug scandals. One night in 2001 he was on stage in New York, in Pinter\u2019s Celebration, and he went blank. He was 24 and had stayed up all night smoking crack. Pinter \u201cbollocked\u201d him, but it took a few more years before Dyer took himself to rehab, slowly becoming the meditative family man he is today. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to try and squeeze as much fucking joy out of life as you possibly can,\u201d he goes on. \u201cBecause the one thing I learned when I was going through some crazy times is that your fucking brain is your worst enemy. It questions us all the time and we can\u2019t escape it.\u201d Every evening he takes 10 minutes to meditate, \u201cand just completely concentrate on my breath, and let all the fucking shit go, then have a good night\u2019s sleep and then attack the day again.\u201d In rehab he had therapy, where for the first time he started talking about his father. \u201cThere\u2019s little holes. You\u2019ve got stuff missing within your soul and you don\u2019t know why and you try and fill it with drugs or drink and it doesn\u2019t work. And so I learned from going to therapy that I had abandonment issues from men.\u201d After his father left, his beloved grandad died from cancer, \u201cand that sent me off the rails a little bit, but then that was around the time I met Pinter. I wasn\u2019t looking for a father figure, but he took me under his wing.\u201d When Pinter died in 2008, \u201cI pushed my \u2018fuck-it button\u2019. It was about destroying relationships before they could fuck me over. Which is why I sort of went a bit crazy.\u201d Therapy helped him understand himself, but, \u201cI think doing Who Do You Think You Are? helped me as well.\u201d This is the BBC genealogy show that, in 2016, aired its \u201cbest episode ever\u201d. Dyer had no idea, after they\u2019d investigated his family tree, what they were going to reveal. \u201cI knew there was an energy,\u201d he remembers. \u201cI thought it might have something to do with criminality. I was hoping for some sort of old-school Shakespearean actor, something that would make me go, \u2018Oh I\u2019ve got it in my blood.\u2019 Then, the way it panned out was fucking ridiculous.\u201d Dyer discovered he was a direct descendant of King Edward III; when he was told, sitting in the choir of Westminster Abbey, he looked as though he was going to faint. The relative he was more excited to discover, though, was Thomas Cromwell, his \u201c15 times great-grandfather. He was a working-class kid who rose through the ranks and was really clever and became a medieval righthand man, and he had no right! And so I thought, \u2018OK, I can see similarities in the sense that he had no right to be where he was either.\u2019\u201d He thinks for a second. \u201cAnd his downfall obviously was that he became almost too powerful and he didn\u2019t fit the mould. He didn\u2019t have any aristocrat parents to get him out of trouble. And his last act, his last roll of the dice\u2026\u201d he grins, surprised to find he is, in fact, holding some dice, \u201cwhich is why I\u2019m sitting here today, is that he got his son to marry Jane Seymour\u2019s sister. If he hadn\u2019t done that Gregory would have been killed as well.\u201d Then they had a child and their child had a child, \u201cand then I\u2019m 15 generations later. He was really famous and out of his depth slightly. So it made me go, \u2018My life makes sense to me now\u2019.\u201d doing the other documentaries? \u201cNo, not really, because I needed money to feed my children. I\u2019m just plying my trade as an actor, like a spark would, or a plumber.\u201d Twenty years ago he made a film called The Football Factory, \u201cwhich made me very famous, but I didn\u2019t get any money for it. So I was stuck in that weird room of being famous, but not having the money to back it up.\u201d Then the documentaries came along. \u201cI had no desire to run around the country speaking to hooligans, meeting them under dark tunnels with balaclavas on and all that. I wasn\u2019t on something journalistic, but it got me a house. That\u2019s the truth.\u201d At the time he was still living on the same council estate where he\u2019d grown up. \u201cI\u2019m very proud of where I\u2019m from. I\u2019m very proud of my roots. And I love the people who inhabit them spaces, but I knew that I needed to get out and try and give my kids a better life.\u201d Which again, he doesn\u2019t regret, but it does add a layer of confusion to his family life. \u201cTrying to instil working-class values in kids who are being driven around in a fucking Bentley is very difficult, you know?\u201d He moved to Essex, had more children, and went viral a number of times for his political commentary. (One memorable clip from 2018 saw him opposite Jeremy Corbyn on Good Morning Britain questioning why David Cameron, \u201cthat twat\u201d had \u201cdisappeared\u201d amid the Brexit chaos. \u201cHe\u2019s in Nice with his trotters up! He should be held accountable for it!\u201d) Yet he says the press still associate him with violence. \u201cThe media have always labelled me \u2018hard-man Danny Dyer\u2019. I don\u2019t know where that\u2019s come from. Is it going back to classism and because I swear a lot? Is it that? It always seems to be about trying to bring me down and catch me out. Especially now in a world of cancel culture.\u201d In 2010, he was sacked from a ghost-written column in lads mag Zoo, for apparently advising a man who couldn\u2019t get over his ex-girlfriend to \u201ccut his ex\u2019s face, then no one will want her\u201d. It had been a line from a film, he said he\u2019d been misquoted, but the backlash was serious and still impacts the way he\u2019s seen. \u201cEverything\u2019s divisive, you know. We\u2019re all being segregated, we\u2019ve regressed as a human race, I feel. There\u2019s no love. Why the fuck are we not looking after each other as human beings? What\u2019s going on? It\u2019s probably because the elite have been exposed a little bit. And the media are fighting back, making us go, well, you\u2019re either this or you\u2019re that. You can\u2019t be all things.\u201d We\u2019re meeting the week before the election, and Dyer\u2019s ambivalent about voting. He sighs. \u201cWhat does worry me, I suppose, is the Tories have fucked it so much that they disappear off the face of the earth, and then Labour get in and there\u2019s no one to challenge them. There\u2019s just something about Starmer I can\u2019t quite buy into. I feel he\u2019s trying too hard to be a common person.\u201d Watching the debates, he found himself asking, \u201c\u2018What the fuck? You are a knight, but you\u2019re meant to be part of a working-class party?\u2019 I just despair at it all and don\u2019t really believe a lot of what they say. Let\u2019s see what the fuck happens and hopefully it changes for the better. I pray, for everybody\u2019s sanity.\u201d He downs his coffee, bitterly. \u201cI don\u2019t know, darling, we\u2019re so lost. Everybody hates the Tories and quite rightly, but we\u2019re not inspired by the Labour party. Who the fuck do we trust? We need more working-class people in politics, it\u2019s very simple. Maybe they\u2019ll put Angela Rayner in later, when Keir gets found out. I watch her and go, \u2018I believe you. I believe your soul.\u2019 And they\u2019re all pretty soulless at the moment, I think.\u201d He shrugs. When Dyer made How to be a Man, his most recent documentary, \u201cI felt the idea of masculinity was being manipulated,\u201d he says. I mention Nigel Farage\u2019s recent praise of Andrew Tate and his defence of \u201cmale culture\u201d. Dyer leans back. \u201cAndrew Tate only exists because the media write about how masculinity is toxic. That\u2019s how you create a space for Andrew Tate to exist. Some of the stuff he says is very fucking interesting. The problem is, he\u2019s such a cock. It\u2019s OK to want to be a provider and protector, it\u2019s a natural instinct for a man. But if we\u2019re going to keep bollocking men for being too masculine and also bollocking them for not opening up about their feelings\u2026 You can\u2019t have it both ways.\u201d He sees how his daughters \u201cthink they want a bit of a prick, someone who\u2019s unattainable, a bad boy. But actually later on in life, which is what Dani\u2019s learned, they want a man who\u2019s going to be strong and there for her.\u201d He looks like he\u2019s welling up when he talks about her partner, West Ham forward Bowen. \u201cWhat Jarrod did by taking on her son at 18 months old, it says a lot about a man.\u201d And to have a West Ham player as a son-in-law? He grins. \u201cThat\u2019s a real bonus for me as a dad.\u201d his new era, as a 46-year-old grandfather to three toddlers, pointing now to the dummy on the counter. \u201cEvery day is a fucking lesson to me and throwing being a grandad into the mix, it\u2019s a fucking amazing feeling.\u201d He describes the logistics of babysitting as if it\u2019s a football game, gesturing with swift firm movements. \u201cSo you\u2019ve got twins that are one, and all they want to do is kill themselves. So what they do is they wait for that door to open and they make a bolt for it so they can roll down the stairs.\u201d He is responsible for making sure they don\u2019t die. \u201cBut at the same time, you\u2019ve got the three-year-old running around smashing shit up and he likes to wind us up by opening the door.\u201d A footballer\u2019s career is short, he points out, so while Dani is parenting alone much of the time now, Bowen will be back with his family for good in a few years. Dyer can relate to the idea of sacrificing your home life for a career. \u201cIt\u2019s all intense and it\u2019s wonderful and then you just wake up one day and it\u2019s done, and then you come back to your life.\u201d He picks up the dice again. \u201cYou commit completely fully, you hold your soul to it, and then it stops, and then you have to come back and sort of just, shrug it off, you know what I mean?\u201d In his new comedy, Mr Bigstuff, Dyer\u2019s character arrives to teach his estranged brother how to be a man. \u201cIt\u2019s like, you need to find that inner cunt inside you. And when I use that word, it\u2019s all about intent.\u201d What is a perfect man? \u201cI would like to think the perfect man will be able to build you a cupboard, but also like a bit of a gossip. So I can curl up on the sofa and watch Marley and Me and cry. But also be able to throw his missus around the bedroom like a caveman.\u201d As he entered his 40s, Dyer realised he was questioning himself less. \u201cI know what I\u2019m about now \u2013 you tend to not care so much about what people fucking think about you.\u201d Looking in the makeup mirror on a recent job, he says: \u201cI started to notice I was going bald, but I realise that\u2019s part of the ageing process. I understand I\u2019m starting to be the shape of an avocado. But that\u2019s what a middle-aged body is. And I\u2019m accepting it. I smoke and I drink, I like to enjoy life, and I don\u2019t want to become a person who calls potatoes \u2018carbs\u2019. I don\u2019t want white bread to be the enemy. So I\u2019m a middle-aged man and I enjoy it.\u201d He gazes briefly, proudly around his clean white house and Debbie huffs her way towards him, collapsing like a tyre at his feet. \u201cIt\u2019s weird getting older, because you become aware of how long you\u2019ve got left. I reckon I\u2019ve got another half my life to go\u201d \u2013 finally, he throws the dice \u2013 \u201cand I intend to enjoy it.\u201d All episodes of Mr Bigstuff are available on Sky and NOW from 17 July Styling by Helen Seamons and Steph Stevens; photographer\u2019s assistant Adam Orzechowski; grooming by Dani Guinsberg using Shakeup Cosmetics",

        "text": "The text messages that open Brittney Griner\u2019s memoir are a chilling short story. \u201cHey baby I got stopped by security at customs.\u201d \u201cIf you don\u2019t hear from me for like one hour or more get my agent on the phone.\u201d \u201cWake up plz.\u201d \u201cBaby text me plz I\u2019m freaking out.\u201d \u201cBaby.\u201d \u201cHello.\u201d \u201cThis is it for me.\u201d The date was 17 February 2022 and Griner, one of the best basketball players in the world, was at a Moscow airport on her way to meet up with UMMC Ekaterinburg, for whom she played in the WNBA off-season. Back at her Arizona home it was 2am and her wife, Relle, was sleeping. Two near-empty vials of medicinal cannabis oil had just been found in Griner\u2019s bag. Her phone and passport were taken, and she was made to sign a document in a language she didn\u2019t understand. After 19 hours at customs, she was led away in handcuffs. \u201cThe future,\u201d she writes in Coming Home, \u201cwas unimaginable.\u201d Days later, Russia invaded Ukraine. The detention of an American double Olympic champion on drugs charges was a political plot-point, and Griner\u2019s ordeal was sealed. While her family, friends and fellow athletes lobbied the White House to secure her release, celebrities including Justin Bieber and Jada Pinkett Smith joined their #WeAreBG campaign to keep up the pressure. It took nine months before state officials finally brought Griner home through a prisoner exchange. In this book she reveals the reality of what she went through during that time and the result is a biography that could legitimately be shelved under horror. The details may be grim but it\u2019s the descent into powerlessness that is so disturbing, as Griner is sucked into a draconian and corrupt penal system where her future freedom depends on no less comforting a figure than Vladimir Putin himself. It is some feat to create so much suspense in a story when the world already knows the outcome. The tension builds from the very first page, as we\u2019re thrown at pace into the entirely avoidable accident that precipitates events. Griner, rushing for a flight, throws her travel items into a carry-on she hasn\u2019t properly checked. She misses her plane from JFK, catches the next. \u201cIf my day had gone as planned,\u201d she muses, later. \u201cIf. If. If.\u201d Instead, in an unusually busy customs hall, the 6ft 9in black athlete is among a group of foreigners pulled out of the line for a bag search, and in a zipped pocket at the back is a forgotten vape cartridge. Its contents aren\u2019t enough to get anyone high, but they are enough to land her a charge of smuggling as well as possession. We follow Griner\u2019s nightmare journey through various places of imprisonment. Denied bail, she was held ahead of trial at a women\u2019s prison outside Moscow, reliant on the kindness of an English-speaking cellmate, Alena, to help her navigate her way through its rules and routines. The squalor and humiliations mount, from the rusty-brown showers to the strip-searches from guards who refuse to believe she\u2019s a woman. In one filthy basement cell, \u201cthe walls were covered in black soot and piss, or whatever bodily fluid I smelled\u201d. After the shock of her sentencing \u2013 Griner received nine years, nearly the maximum penalty \u2013 she is transported to a former gulag and the train journey takes over a week. Lying inside a cage, on a metal bunk far too small for her frame, she regrets the loss of one of her few possessions, the sudoku book that she had kept with her since her arrest. Relle had already completed one of the puzzles and signed her name next to it. \u201cWhen I felt down I turned to that page and rubbed her signature on my cheek.\u201d Griner\u2019s co-writer, Michelle Burford, a founding editor of O, The Oprah Magazine, weaves the swooping drama of the high-stakes narrative with empathic glimpses of Griner\u2019s upbringing. Growing up black and extremely tall attracted plenty of unwelcome attention, while her parents worried there was something medically wrong with her. When she came out, her father, Ray, who had fought in the Vietnam war before becoming a policeman, yelled at her (\u201cI ain\u2019t raising no gay bitch!\u201d) and she left home. And yet their ongoing love for each other is palpable, and the toughness he instilled in her helped her survive in prison. We learn, too, about the efforts that Relle, a lawyer, and Griner\u2019s tireless agent, Lindsay Kagawa Colas, were making while she grappled with the prospect of being incarcerated for a decade. \u201cA freedom campaign has a question at its heart,\u201d writes Griner: \u201c\u2018Who deserves our sympathy?\u2019\u201d It is, perhaps, the book\u2019s most powerful and poignant question. Griner\u2019s story ends not with her return to the WNBA, but with a list of Americans still held hostage around the world, including former marine Paul Whelan and Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich in Russia. Her book should also shout a warning about the dangerous political waters in which the sports industry defiantly continues to swim. Perhaps it\u2019s unreasonable to expect women\u2019s basketballers to turn down life-changing sums to play in an overseas league run by oligarchs and former spies, especially when their own national league makes them fly economy. But you can question the \u201cbubble\u201d mentality and moral ignorance that accompanies the decision-making of both the athletes and those running international sport. Griner herself loved the seven years she played in Russia and admits: \u201cI couldn\u2019t see the dirty politics, the corruption, the old-school views of women.\u201d The country\u2019s record on LGBTQ+ rights didn\u2019t seem to factor either, since she herself always felt safe. What is so frightening about sportswashing, from the Qatari World Cup to Saudi Arabia\u2019s LIV Golf and Pro League football, is that it appears irresistible to athletes, administrators and fans alike. Even since Griner\u2019s arrest, a number of Americans, including current WNBA players Kayla Thornton and Monique Billings, continued to play in the Russian league. Some who find the prospect too uncomfortable have headed to Turkey instead. Griner herself has made a successful return to basketball and will represent the USA in the Olympics later this month. Her professional comeback is all the more extraordinary given the difficulties she has continued to face, from PTSD episodes to security threats that required her and Relle to sell their home. The couple are expecting the birth of their first child this month: expect Griner\u2019s story to be one of the most talked about in Paris.",

        "text": "Keir Starmer has promised a new era of closer relations with Europe to ensure future generations can look back \u201con what our continent achieved together\u201d before a key meeting of European leaders this week. Starmer said Europe as a whole faced security crises and linked problems over migration, and that Britain should be at the heart of the continent\u2019s efforts to confront them. In his most positive comments about the UK and Europe since he campaigned against Brexit and for a second referendum, the prime minister said that Europe was \u201cat the forefront of some of the greatest challenges of our time\u201d. Speaking before a meeting at Blenheim Palace on Thursday of the European Political Community, he said: \u201cRussia\u2019s barbaric war continues to reverberate across our continent, while vile smuggling gangs traffic innocent people on perilous journeys that too often end in tragedy. \u201cWe cannot be spectators in this chapter of history. We must do more and go further, not just for the courageous Ukrainians on the frontlines, or those being trafficked from country to country, but so our future generations look back with pride at what our continent achieved together. \u201cI said I would change the way the UK engages with our European partners, working collaboratively to drive forward progress on these generational challenges,and that work starts at the European Political Community meeting on Thursday.\u201d Starmer has repeatedly ruled out rejoining the EU, its single market or customs union. As opposition leader, he was reluctant to express his pro-Europeanism for fear of being accused of wanting to reverse Brexit. But now, after his emphatic election win, UK and European diplomats are detecting a shift in tone. The first step is likely to see the UK and EU move towards a new security pact to deal better with issues such as Ukraine. There is also speculation that there could be agreements on a new youth mobility scheme and possibly, further down the line, mutual recognition of some professional qualifications. Downing Street said the prime minister was clear: \u201cThe United Kingdom is always stronger when working in close collaboration with others.\u201d A statement said: \u201cThe UK government will use the summit to discuss closer collaboration to tackle illegal immigration and greater security cooperation with European counterparts to keep Britain safe.\u201d Before the summit, the prime minister will host the Irish taoiseach, Simon Harris, for his first official visit since entering Downing Street. The prime minister will also hold a bilateral dinner with the French president, Emmanuel Macron, in Blenheim Palace, the birthplace of Winston Churchill, after the summit. The EPC was set up by Macron in 2022 to tackle issues that could best be addressed outside the formal EU structures. The EPC meeting comes after a stepping up of Russian aggression in Ukraine. Starmer has been clear that the UK\u2019s support for Ukraine is guaranteed and that he will use the meeting as a platform to push for continued international military and financial backing. Starmer said in Washington last week that he had discussed a \u201cformal mechanism\u201d for UK-EU security cooperation during bilateral meetings at the Nato summit, and that a plan to repair post-Brexit damage had been well received by allies. President Joe Biden told Starmer: \u201cI kind of see you guys as the knot tying the transatlantic alliance together, the closer you are with Europe.\u201d Starmer said at the close of the summit: \u201cThere was a sense after Brexit that the UK has become too inward looking, was not as interested as it once was in its place on the global stage. The UK is confident, is back.\u201d Peter Ricketts, a former British ambassador to France, said: \u201cSunak has gifted Starmer the perfect platform to consolidate his position as a leading figure on European security, with Biden, Macron and Scholz all in deep electoral trouble. In my experience, the parliamentary training makes UK politicians effective at chairing and brokering solutions at big meetings, and the FCDO will have prepared the ground well.So this is a real opportunity to show that Britain is back at the centre of diplomacy.\u201d",

        "text": "When the new British prime minister, Keir Starmer, invited Wes Streeting into Downing Street to appoint him health secretary on Friday 5 July, the exchanges behind closed doors were entirely cordial. But things rarely run 100% smoothly in the first days of a new administration as a complete government jigsaw is put together, piece by piece. According to a well-placed source, when Streeting left the prime minister\u2019s office, Bridget Phillipson was waiting her turn outside. A very senior civil servant was helping to oversee the process and, ushering Streeting out and Phillipson in, is said to have mistakenly referred to the former as \u201ceducation secretary\u201d. \u201cNot surprisingly, it did not go down well [with Phillipson], until he corrected himself,\u201d said the source. \u201cBridget got the job she expected, but for a second or two, things were apparently a bit tense, to say the least.\u201d Broadly speaking, however, the transition from Tory to a Labour administration has gone as smoothly as anyone could have hoped for. In some instances, it has gone rather too well. When Ed Miliband walked into the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero and addressed civil servants for the first time, there was so much cheering and \u201cwhooping\u201d that a senior mandarin in the department had to tell those making the noise to pipe down, fearing it sounded more like a political rally than a respectful welcome from an entirely neutral Whitehall machine. \u201cI think the intended message was that you can\u2019t, as civil servants, make it sound too much like you are thrilled to have the Tories out, even though it felt like everyone was,\u201d said an insider. Similarly rapturous welcomes were given to other new ministers: Liz Kendall at work and pensions, Phillipson at education and Shabana Mahmood at justice. On Monday afternoon, when Streeting addressed staff assembled in the canteen at the Department of Health and Social Care, the place was stuffed to overflowing. Streeting had invited NHS England employees to be there too, to show that he wanted everyone to work together to mend what he has called a \u201cbroken\u201d service. Streeting told them he wanted to be challenged and presented with hard truths. \u201cThere was an incredible atmosphere,\u201d said one person who was there. Another said: \u201cIt was like a massive, massive relief and change of mood.\u201d This weekend, the new government is enjoying, and feeding off, a wave of positivity, not just in Westminster and Whitehall but across the country. Somewhat fortunately for Starmer and his ministers, their moment \u2013 and the arrival of 334 new MPs in Westminster \u2013 has coincided with a patriotic frenzy caused by England reaching the final of Euro 2024 and some better economic news. Friday\u2019s Financial Times led with the headline: \u201cSterling surges as GDP data buoys Labour growth agenda\u201d \u2013 wrapping the themes of political and economic optimism into one. Members of the new government seemed genuinely excited and encouraged last week by the public response to Westminster\u2019s changing of the guard. \u201cThe most striking thing for me,\u201d said one front-rank Labour minister, \u201cis how many people have just come up to me in the street or on the train and said: \u2018So glad you are there, good luck \u2013 so pleased to have seen the back of the Tories.\u2019\u201d In parliament, the new intake arrived on Monday and Tuesday in massed ranks, symbols of a new political era, many of them youthful, wide-eyed and in awe. Vikki Slade, the new Liberal Democrat MP for Mid Dorset and North Poole, could not believe how her workplace functioned and the reverence with which she was treated from the off. \u201cI was walking towards the members\u2019 lobby [outside the chamber] and two officials just opened the doors for me, on either side, to let me through. I couldn\u2019t believe it,\u201d she said. Her colleague James MacCleary, who won Lewes for the Lib Dems, felt he was suffering from \u201cimpostor syndrome\u201d when he was shown a round the Commons chamber. \u201cI said I presumed I was not allowed to sit down on the green benches yet and they said: \u2018You are an MP now \u2013 of course you are allowed to sit there.\u2019\u201d Some long-serving MPs, veterans of the previous parliament, said they felt a little left out, as if tainted by association with discredited political times. \u201cThe new intake is getting all the attention. We have to do something to show it is not just about them,\u201d said one. \u201cIt is all a bit weird.\u201d Recently appointed Labour ministers who had worked for their moment for years struggled to sum up their feelings. Speaking to the Observer after a day in post, one said: \u201cI have gone from a pokey office in Portcullis House to a floor of a major department with the civil servants all around. It is quite extraordinary. Suddenly, I feel like we have this massive opportunity to get things done.\u201d But will they succeed? Behind the euphoria, there is trepidation. Labour ministers and MPs know full well that the honeymoon will not last. They are asking themselves how, given the dire state of public services \u2013 overcrowded prisons, an overburdened and understaffed NHS, schools with crumbling buildings and a shortage of teachers \u2013 and the lack of money in Treasury coffers, can they turn things around before the public mood sours again? Another new minister said there was absolutely no time to waste. \u201cI would say we have two and a half years to make an impression before the nerves set in again,\u201d he said. His point was after that juncture, his party, which secured just under 34% of the vote on 4 July despite gaining a huge majority, would be too fearful of threats from the left and right to do bold things and would start worrying about the next election. Over recent days, a good start has been made. The new chancellor, Rachel Reeves, has pledged a return to compulsory housebuilding targets and Miliband has revoked the Tories\u2019 de facto ban on onshore windfarms. Very deliberately, however, much of the emphasis has been on demonstrating the extent of the mess left by the Conservatives. Streeting\u2019s remarks about the broken NHS, and Starmer and Mahmood\u2019s decision to approve the release of thousands of prisoners to prevent a total breakdown in law and order, were not only designed to discredit the past regime but also to buy Labour time. \u201cThe more we can show how badly they left everything, the more people will realise it is not easy to fix and how important responsible government now is,\u201d said a Labour strategist. In a column for Friday\u2019s Guardian on his first week running the country, Starmer wrote of the Tory record: \u201cLike a Downing Street party, they\u2019ve left a mountain of mess for this government to clean up.\u201d Confidence among the new team of Labour ministers and MPs has been bolstered by the way Starmer has settled in so fast, seeming at ease with so much power and responsibility at his fingertips. As opposition leader and throughout the election campaign, the adjectives \u201cdull\u201d and \u201cwooden\u201d stuck to him like glue. \u201cNow he looks like he was absolutely made to be prime minister,\u201d said one of his senior ministers. On his first overseas trip as the nation\u2019s leader, to a Nato summit in Washington DC, Starmer looked and sounded the part, appearing centre stage in team photos, easefully handling a meeting with the increasingly frail US president, Joe Biden, joking about the football and, afterwards, effortlessly batting away questions about the president\u2019s mental state. On the way to Washington, Starmer had oozed confidence, risking a comment about England never having missed a single penalty under this Labour government. He and his wife, Victoria, have also received positive photo spreads in the pages of the Daily Mail, the Times and the Daily Telegraph. On Saturday, in an article in the Daily Mail, the rightwing columnist Leo McKinstry wrote: \u201cAs an unwavering opponent of Labour I was dreading Labour\u2019s socialist new dawn. But even I am reassured by Starmer\u2019s promising first week after years of chaos and division.\u201d This week, King Charles will unveil the new government\u2019s legislative programme for the forthcoming session of parliament. Amid great pageantry, Starmer and Rishi Sunak will walk side by side from the House of Commons to the Lords before the speech is read out. What they will discuss on the short journey will be the subject of much speculation among the commentators. The king\u2019s speech will contain a range of important bills on the NHS, standards in schools, mental health, energy and the environment. The message will be one of continued momentum, improving the nation\u2019s key public services and the pursuit above all of economic growth. The following day, Starmer will host more than 45 European leaders at Blenheim Palace in Oxfordshire for a meeting of the European Political Community. Much of the emphasis will be on closer defence cooperation between the UK and EU. But it is also expected that Starmer will use the occasion to start rebuilding relations with our European neighbours in a broader sense, both economically and politically, post-Brexit. One minister with some knowledge of the brief remarked: \u201cI don\u2019t think you will hear anything dramatic but there will be a change of tone. It will be another indication that this government wants to show it is serious about changing the country for the better.\u201d",

        "text": "The U.S. Secret Service is investigating how a gunman armed with an AR-style rifle was able to get close enough to shoot and injure former President Donald Trump at a rally Saturday in Pennsylvania, a monumental failure of one the agency\u2019s core duties. The gunman, who was killed by Secret Service personnel, fired multiple shots at the stage from an \u201celevated position outside of the rally venue,\u201d the agency said. An Associated Press analysis of more than a dozen videos and photos taken at the Trump rally, as well as satellite imagery of the site, shows the shooter, was able to get astonishingly close to the stage where the former president was speaking. A video posted to social media and geolocated by the AP shows the body of a man wearing gray camouflage lying motionless on the roof of a manufacturing plant just north of the Butler Farm Show grounds, where Trump\u2019s rally was held. The roof was less than 150 meters (yards) from where Trump was speaking, a distance from which a decent marksman could reasonably hit a human-sized target. For reference, 150 meters is a distance at which U.S. Army recruits must hit a scaled human-sized silhouette to qualify with the M16 assault rifle in basic training. The AR-15, like the shooter at the Trump rally had, is the semi-automatic civilian version of the military M16. The FBI early Sunday identified the shooter as Thomas Matthew Crooks, 20, of Bethel Park, Pennsylvania. The Secret Service didn\u2019t have anybody at a late-night news conference where FBI and Pennsylvania State Police officials briefed reporters on the shooting investigation. FBI Special Agent in Charge Kevin Rojek said it was \u201csurprising\u201d that the gunman was able to fire at the stage before he was killed. Members of the Secret Service\u2019s counter sniper team and counter assault team were at the rally, according to two law enforcement officials. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren\u2019t authorized to discuss details of the investigation. The heavily-armed counter assault team, whose Secret Service code name is \u201cHawkeye,\u201d is responsible for eliminating threats so that other agents can shield and take away the person they are protecting. The counter sniper team, known by the code name \u201cHercules,\u201d uses long-range binoculars and is equipped with sniper rifles to deal with long-range threats. U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas said his department and the Secret Service are working with law enforcement to investigate the shooting. Maintaining the security of presidential candidates and their campaign events is one of the department\u2019s \u201cmost vital priorities,\u201d he said. \u201cWe condemn this violence in the strongest possible terms and commend the Secret Service for their swift action today,\u201d Mayorkas said. \u201cWe are engaged with President Biden, former President Trump and their campaigns, and are taking every possible measure to ensure their safety and security.\u201c Calls for an investigation came from all sides. James Comer, a Kentucky Republican who is the House Oversight Committee chairman, said he contacted the Service Service for a briefing and called on Director Kimberly Cheatle to appear for a hearing. Comer said his committee will send a formal invitation soon. \u201cPolitical violence in all forms is unamerican and unacceptable. There are many questions and Americans demand answers,\u201d Comer said in a statement. U.S. Rep. Ritchie Torres, a New York Democrat, called for investigating \u201csecurity failures\u201d at the rally. \u201cThe federal government must constantly learn from security failures in order to avoid repeating them, especially when those failures have implications for the nation,\u201d Torres said. Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers, a Democrat, posted on X that he and his staff are in contact with security planning coordinators ahead of the Republican National Convention set to begin Monday in Milwaukee. \u201cWe cannot be a country that accepts political violence of any kind \u2014 that is not who we are as Americans,\u201d Evers said. The FBI said it will lead the investigation into the shooting, working with the Secret Service and local and state law enforcement. Attorney General Merrick Garland said the Justice Department \u201cwill bring every available resource to bear to this investigation.\u201d \u201cMy heart is with the former President, those injured, and the family of the spectator killed in this horrific attack,\u201d Garland said in a statement. \u201cWe will not tolerate violence of any kind, and violence like this is an attack on our democracy.\u201d ___ By Michael Biesecker and Michael Kunzelman Associated Press Associated Press writers Colleen Long and Zeke Miller in Washington contributed to this report.",

        "text": "The attempted assassination of Donald Trump by a gunman at his Pennsylvania rally has confirmed the worst fears of public figures warning that an escalation in incendiary political rhetoric on all sides could lead to bloodshed.US lawmakers and analysts have been voicing concern since the 2021 US Capitol riot that increasingly bellicose campaign language was becoming a worrying contusion on the US body politic ahead of November's presidential election. The danger was vividly illustrated in 2022, when then-House speaker Nancy Pelosi's husband was attacked with a hammer by a far-right conspiracy theorist who wanted to hold the Democratic leader hostage and \"break her kneecaps.\"The political affiliations of Saturday's shooter, identified as 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks, were not immediately clear -- but analysts and politicians immediately pointed the finger at extreme political discourse.\"For weeks Democrat leaders have been fueling ludicrous hysteria that Donald Trump winning re-election would be the end of democracy in America,\" House Republican Majority Leader Steve Scalise, who was seriously wounded in a mass shooting at a congressional sports event in 2017, said on X.\"Clearly we've seen far left lunatics act on violent rhetoric in the past. This incendiary rhetoric must stop.\"Senior Trump campaign aide Chris LaCivita assailed the language of \"leftist activists, Democrat donors and even Joe Biden.\" While Ajamu Baraka, Green Party candidate Jill Stein's running mate in 2016, suggested Democratic rhetoric might have led the gunman to see it as his \"patriotic duty to eliminate an existential threat to the nation.\" \"The chickens have really come home to roost,\" he posted on X.What none of the three acknowledged was that Trump himself has been a major architect of the coarsening in US political discourse in recent years.Many of Trump's targets in Congress and the government -- from Republican Senator Mitt Romney to retired top government scientist Anthony Fauci -- have disclosed having to take on private security after threats from Trump's supporters.The former US president sparked fury last year when he implied that the country's top military officer should be executed, and joked about the Pelosi hammer attack.Trump's exhortations to violence are nothing new -- he suggested that protesters should be \"roughed up\" at a rally in 2016, and that looters should be shot during the 2020 racial protests over the police murder of George Floyd. He has also repeatedly described the attorneys leading the multiple civil and criminal cases he faces as \"monster,\" \"deranged\" and \"psycho.\"And, of course, many argue he incited the deadly Capitol riot on January 6, 2021, when he exhorted his followers to \"fight like hell\" shortly before they stormed the seat of US government, leaving five people dead. Republicans have in the past accused Democrats of overreacting to figurative language and ignoring leftist aggression, such as harassment of conservative Supreme Court justices and the 2017 shooting that wounded Scalise.Still, law enforcement agencies say that while threats have proliferated from every corner, right-wing violence is the bigger worry. Discourse that was once taboo is now commonplace on the far right, with Republican flamethrowers in Congress incorporating violent language and imagery into their stump speeches.Threats against members of Congress of all stripes reached a record high of 9,625 in 2021, according to data provided by the Capitol Police, compared with just 3,939 in 2017.Robert Pape of the University of Chicago has conducted several polls on political violence since the Capitol assault. In his latest last month, 10 percent of respondents said the use of force was \"justified to prevent Donald Trump from becoming president.\"\"The shooting of former President Trump is a consequence of such significant support for political violence in our country,\" he told AFP. \"We also need to worry about threat in retribution to President Biden. Our survey shows seven percent of American adults -- 18 million -- support force to restore Trump to the presidency, half of whom own guns.\" Political analyst Charlie Kolean called for Americans to stand together \"in condemning such violence and work towards ensuring the safety and security of all public officials.\" \"Today's events are a stark reminder of the threats our leaders face,\" Kolean, the chief strategy officer at conservative-leaning political consultancy RED PAC, told AFP.\"An attack on the presidential candidate is an attack on our democracy.\"",

        "text": "CAROLINA, Puerto Rico -- Vianca Bra\u00f1a never used to attend basketball games in her hometown of Carolina, Puerto Rico \u2014 or anywhere else in the United States territory. But in recent years, the 23-year-old has left the arena with a hoarse voice, often wearing a T-shirt that reads \u201cCarola,\u201d a nickname for her town. \u201cWe started making this fun, and I wanted to represent the town where I'm from,\u201d said Bra\u00f1a, who attended her first game the year Puerto Rican reggaeton star Bad Bunny bought a team in the island\u2019s professional men\u2019s basketball league. It was also around that time that she began placing bets on different teams across Puerto Rico with her girlfriends. Bra\u00f1a\u2019s fervor illustrates how Puerto Rico's professional men's basketball league is experiencing a revival, driven by reggaeton stars like Bad Bunny, Ozuna and Anuel AA, who are stepping into the financial game, buying local teams and helping to stack up a loyal fan base the island hasn\u2019t witnessed in over 40 years. What were once half-empty arenas in Puerto Rico are now packed, filled with families and young fans cheering for their favorite teams, from Los Capitanes de Arecibo in northern Puerto Rico to Los Leones de Ponce in the south. Attendance more than doubled from 2018 to 2023, skyrocketing from some 480,000 tickets sold to nearly 1 million, according to Puerto Rico's professional men\u2019s basketball league, whose digital presence has also soared in the past few years. A pivotal moment in the league\u2019s revival came in 2021, when three-time Grammy winner Bad Bunny became co-owner of Los Cangrejeros de Santurce, along with his manager, Noah Assad. Bad Bunny\u2019s frequent game-day visits sparked a resurgence in Puerto Rico's basketball scene. Other artists like Anuel AA quickly followed, buying Arecibo\u2019s Capitanes team before a new owner took over in 2023, and Ozuna acquiring Manat\u00ed\u2019s team, renaming it Los Osos, in 2022. The league, known as BSN, currently has 12 teams playing, compared with nine just four years ago. Basketball games have transformed into premier rendezvous events, attracting celebrities like NBA legend LeBron James, former boxer Floyd Mayweather and reggaeton artists including Arcangel and Rauw Alejandro, capturing audiences of all ages hoping to get a glimpse of them. \u201cWhen Noah and Bad Bunny came along, we generated a lot of noise,\u201d said Ricardo Dalmau, president of BSN. \u201cIt was an explosion of attention.\u201d Dalmau said local TV ratings also saw an upward tick after they began broadcasting some games in 2021, with the biggest surprise being their largest viewership block: women ages 18 to 49, a new audience that was also reflected in the bleachers. \u201cYou never know what artist you\u2019re going to find in the (league),\u201d he said. Before its recent surge in popularity, the league was under financial strain. Although Dalmau did not provide specific numbers, he said there used to be a lot of uncertainty about whether certain teams would participate or whether the league could fulfill players\u2019 contracts. \u201cWe don't have those problems anymore,\" he said. Javier Sabath, a popular basketball commentator on the island, said he is witnessing what his father \u2014 a sports commentator himself decades ago \u2014 describes as the environment in the 1980s, the heyday of the league. \u201cNew generations have never seen this before,\u201d Sabath said. \u201cThe boom with urban artists revived the Puerto Rican sports history that had been forgotten.\u201d Sabath said the momentum created by artists has fueled fans\u2019 excitement beyond just seeing reggaeton stars. \u201cIndirectly, these artists are attracting enough attention to make people interested in our league,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a domino effect.\u201d A bittersweet moment took place recently, when Puerto Rico national men\u2019s basketball team, composed of several of the league\u2019s star players, qualified for the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris. The victory over Lithuania broke a 20-year drought for the team that last competed in 2004, beating the USA team in the Athens Olympics. It is also a loss for the league\u2019s teams playing later in the summer. The league\u2019s renaissance comes after its peak over 40 years ago. Teams in Bayam\u00f3n, Quebradillas, Ponce and other towns had produced renowned players, including Butch Lee, the first Puerto Rican player to enter the National Basketball Association; Raymond Dalmau, whose son currently presides over the league; and Rub\u00e9n Rodr\u00edguez, who played for Los Vaqueros in Bayam\u00f3n. As part of the current frenzy, ex-NBA players have moved to Puerto Rico in recent years to join the league. Will Barton and Jared Sullinger play for San Juan\u2019s team, while other ex-NBA players like DeMarcus Cousins, Lance Stephenson and Brandon Knight also joined before moving on to other stints. Still, some problems remain beyond the league\u2019s control, including severe budget cuts, with the government slashing the island\u2019s sports and recreation department budget by more than half over the past decade. A lack of investment and maintenance in sports arenas across the island has caused leaks, leading to game suspensions after heavy rains. \u201cDespite the lack of economic resources, we\u2019ve been able to sort it out,\u201d said Ray Qui\u00f1ones, secretary of sports and recreation of Puerto Rico, whose infrastructure budget was cut from about $15,300 in 2014 to barely $7,500 in 2024. Sports arenas face the additional problem of chronic power outages across Puerto Rico, which is still rebuilding its electric grid after Hurricane Mar\u00eda, a Category 4 storm that razed the island in September 2017. In June, a game in Carolina between the home team, Los Gigantes, and Los Indios of Mayag\u00fcez was suspended after a widespread power outage left more than 340,000 customers without electricity. A month earlier, a game in San Juan\u2019s main arena was also suspended due to a power outage. Despite the challenges, younger generations are finding refuge outside their homes \u2014 which also contend with frequent power outages \u2014 and a new sense of pride by attending the games. For fans like Annais Ram\u00edrez, basketball arenas feel like safe spaces, especially for women looking to engage in historically male-dominated areas. \u201cThere are so many artists coming to the games, and you wonder if you\u2019ll run into one,\u201d the 27-year-old said as she stood next to her friend, who sported a necklace with a diamond-encrusted \u201cC\u201d for the town of Carolina. Her love for Carolina\u2019s team has grown beyond her expectation to run into a celebrity. During her free time, Ram\u00edrez goes on social media to catch up on the games she couldn\u2019t attend in person, checking out highlights, halftime performances and crowd reactions. \u201cThose motivate you to be part of the movement,\u201d she said. \u201cOn weekdays, this helps me unwind.\u201d ___ Follow AP\u2019s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america",

        "text": "France does not know where its government is headed and on Sunday the armed forces will also take an unusual detour at the start of their annual Bastille Day march.Preparations to host the Olympic Games blocked the national day parade from its traditional route on the Champs Elysees, and a smaller military contingent will instead march on the nearby Avenue Foch -- one of the most prestigious streets in Paris and one of the most expensive addresses in the world.This will not be the only unusual feature of the the event: France is also without a government, less than two weeks before the Games.All eyes will be on the host, President Emmanuel Macron, who last year cut a more impressive figure, hosting rising superpower India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi at France's triumphant national day parade.But, with the Olympics just around the corner, France has no international star guest for this year's parade -- and French political leaders' minds will be elsewhere, pondering the power vacuum.This month's snap elections, called by Macron to clarify France's direction after the far right sent shockwaves through the political establishment by coming first in European polls, left the country without a ruling minority.Prime Minister Gabriel Attal is hanging on as caretaker head of government but the centrist Macron ally is now focusing on his own future, taking charge of his reduced party in parliament.Other figures are mobilising with an eye on the 2027 presidential race, but there is little sign of a ruling majority emerging from parliament, split between three loose camps.With government in limbo and Macron barred by the constitution from calling fresh elections for 12 months, far-right figurehead Marine Le Pen is eyeing the 2027 race with relish.Meanwhile, first place in the elections was claimed by a rapidly cobbled-together left-wing alliance, the New Popular Front (NFP), which now has the most MPs but no clear candidate for PM.Firebrand hardliner Jean-Luc Melenchon and his France Unbowed (LFI) party has alienated many even on the left, while the centre and right say they would not welcome his MPs into a coalition.The European Union's second largest economy, a nuclear-armed G7 power and permanent member of the UN Security Council, is thus rudderless, a troubling situation for markets and France's allies alike.Against this backdrop, the reduced and rerouted parade risks becoming a new symbol of drift, even with the addition of the arrival in Paris of the Olympic Torch, ahead of the July 26 to August 11 Games.No tank or armoured vehicle will take part, and only 4,000 foot soldiers will march, down from 6,500 last year, but the military fly-past will see 45 aeroplanes and 22 helicopters soar over Paris.Regiments honoured on the parade will include those from France's allies and former French colonies that took part in the country's 1944 World War II liberation 80 years ago.The parade's final section will also honour the Olympic spirit.Colonel Thibault Vallette of the elite Cadre Noir de Saumur cavalry school and 2016 equestrian gold medallist in Rio will be bringing the torch down the route before relay runners carry it around the capital.",

        "text": "10 Most Expensive Celebrity Divorces While celebrity divorces are not significantly different from common divorces, the thing that sets them apart is the large sums of money as well as assets that they part with. This becomes even more complicated when either of the partners or both are famous or extremely wealthy. Meanwhile, experts at EvenBetGaming conducted a comprehensive study to analyze and rank the most expensive celebrity divorces in history. Below are the 10 most costly celebrity divorces of all time including the staggering costs and intricate legal battles. 1. Bill Gates and Melinda Gates Bill Gates and Melinda Gates ended their 27-year marriage with a high-profile divorce in 2021. While talking about the decision, Melinda said, \"It wasn't one moment or one specific thing that happened. There just came a point in time where there was enough there that I realized it just wasn't healthy, and I couldn't trust what we had,\" as reported by PEOPLE. In a joint statement, they said, \"We no longer believe we can grow together as a couple in this next phase of our lives.\" Their divorce is the costliest ever, with a $76 billion settlement. Adjusted for inflation, it\u2019s worth $87.6 billion. 2. Jeff Bezos and MacKenzie Bezos On January 9, 2019, Jeff Bezos and his wife MacKenzie Bezos revealed their decision to part ways. On his X account, Jeff wrote, \"I'm grateful for her support and for her kindness in this process and am very much looking forward to our new relationship as friends and co-parents,\" as reported by Town and Country Magazine. With a staggering $38 billion settlement, now equivalent to $45.3 billion, Jeff and MacKenzie\u2019s divorce ranks second on this list. MacKenzie also stands out as one of the wealthiest women on the list, boasting a net worth of $40.6 billion. 3. Alec Wildenstein and Jocelyn Wildenstein In 1999, after 21 years of marriage, Alec and Jocelyn Wildenstein decided to part ways. According to the study, their divorce settlement, adjusted for inflation, is valued at a whopping $7 billion. Meanwhile, as reported by PEOPLE, talking about the couple, a longtime friend said, \"They were a reclusive couple. They had a tight group of friends and were very quiet people.\" Following the divorce, Jocelyn stayed away from the public spotlight, although she has faced multiple legal challenges in the years since. 4. Rupert Murdoch and Anna Murdoch Rupert Murdoch and Anna Murdoch shared 31 years, making it Rupert's longest marriage. The couple parted ways in April 1998 and finalized their divorce just two months later. Speaking about the divorce, Anna said, \u201cI thought we had a wonderful, happy marriage. Obviously, we didn\u2019t\u2026 I don\u2019t want to get too personal about this\u2026 but [he] was extremely hard, ruthless,\u201d as reported by The Independent. They ended their marriage with a $1.7 billion settlement, which comes up to $3.1 billion when adjusted for inflation. This hefty sum places their split at the fourth place. 5. Kanye West and Kim Kardashian Kim Kardashian and Kanye West officially filed for divorce in 2021, although the cracks in their marriage had started showing years before. As reported by PEOPLE, talking about the decision, Kardashian said, \"For so long, I did what made other people happy. And I think in the last two years I decided, I'm going to make myself happy. And that feels really good. And even if that created changes and caused my divorce, I think it's important to be honest with yourself about what really makes you happy. I've chosen myself.\" Their divorce ranks fifth among the most expensive, with settlements totaling $2.8 billion. 6. Adnan Khashoggi and Soraya Khashoggi Adnan Khashoggi, the flamboyant Saudi arms trader, skyrocketed to immense wealth during the 1970s and 1980s, showcasing luxury that dazzled even in those times. This Saudi billionaire entrepreneur and arms dealer held the record for the world's costliest divorce settlement for nearly two years. Although their divorce proceedings began in 1974, it wasn't until 1979 that Soraya Khashoggi filed her lawsuit, according to CNBC. Their divorce is ranked sixth, with their settlement amounting to a hefty sum of $2.8 billion. 7. Bernie Ecclestone and Slavica Ecclestone Bernie Ecclestone, the Formula One billionaire, divorced his wife Slavica Ecclestone after she left the Kensington residence as indicated by The Standard. The Ecclestones, who were together for 24 years before the marriage failed, are known to live a very simple lifestyle even though they were extremely wealthy. The couple met for the first time in 1982 at the Italian Grand Prix where Slavica was working as a model, and they got married in 1984. Their settlement of $2.4 billion, puts Bernie and Slavica\u2019s divorce at the seventh most expensive celebrity divorce in history. 8. Bill Gross and Sue Gross Bill Gross, the renowned bond investor, went through a very rough time in his personal life when he was divorcing his wife Sue Gross. Sue accused Bill of vandalizing their California mansion, killing the plants, and throwing dead fish into the vents. Bill, on the other hand, claimed that Sue came at him with a silver thing which may have been a knife, as reported by Business Insider. After 32 years of marriage, their split resulted in a $1.6 billion settlement, ranking them eighth on the list of the most expensive celebrity divorces. 9. Steve Wynn and Elaine Wynn Elaine Wynn first met Steve Wynn during their college days, marrying him in 1963. They parted ways in 1986, only to rekindle their relationship five years later. Their second marriage eventually ended in divorce once more in 2010. Talking about their divorce, Steve said, \"The instigation of these accusations is the continued work of my ex-wife Elaine Wynn, with whom I am involved in a terrible and nasty lawsuit in which she is seeking a revised divorce settlement,\" as reported by Town and Country Magazine. They stand ninth on the list with $1.4 billion in settlements. 10. Harold Hamm and Sue Ann Arnall Harold Hamm and Sue Ann Arnall's 2012 divorce marks the conclusion of this list, with a staggering $1.3 billion settlement, according to OK! Magazine. The couple's journey began at Continental, where Harold met Sue Ann, who was working as an attorney and holding various executive positions. They married in 1988 without the protection of a prenuptial agreement. When Sue Ann filed for divorce, she demanded half of the wealth Harold had amassed during their 26-year marriage, as reported by Business Insider.",

The FBI identified the shooter as 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks hours after the incident, reported NBC News. Thomas Crooks, who is reported to be from Pennsylvania, was allegedly killed by the Security Service shortly after shots rang out at the Pennsylvania rally. Secret Service, chief of Communications Anthony Guglielmi later confirmed that he had been \u201cneutralized.\u201d Photos that emerged from the scene suggested Thomas Crooks was a White male. Pennsylvania voter records suggest that Thomas Matthew Crooks was a registered Republican. Thomas Matthew Crooks was listed as a registered Republican and as per voter records, the concerned person had the same address and birth date as the ID'd gunman, reported NBC News. According to Federal Election Commission donor data, a person listed as Thomas Crooks of Pennsylvania was also recorded as donating $15 to ActBlue, a political action committee backing the Democrats, in June 2021. \"The shooter has been tentatively identified. It\u2019s a matter of doing biometric confirmations,\" said State Police Lieutenant Colonel George Bivens. Law enforcement authorities are investigating the incident but are yet to reveal a motive behind the shooting. Crooks allegedly sat on top of the roof of a manufacturing plant 130 yards away from the stage near the Pennsylvania rally, reported the New York Post. An AR-style rifle was recovered by his side shortly after he allegedly shot at Donald Trump. International leaders came out in support of Donald Trump, reported CNN. Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky wrote, \u201cI am appalled to learn about the shooting of former U.S. President Donald Trump at his rally in Pennsylvania. Such violence has no justification and no place anywhere in the world. Never should violence prevail. I am relieved to learn that Donald Trump is now safe and wish him a speedy recovery.\u201d Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif tweeted \u201cJust learned that former President Trump was shot at an election rally. This is a shocking development. I condemn all violence in politics. Wish the former President swift recovery and good health.\u201d Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr, said \u201cIt is with great relief that we receive the news that former President Donald Trump is fine and well after the attempt to assassinate him. Our thoughts and prayers are with him and his family. Together with all democracy-loving peoples around the world, we condemn all forms of political violence. The voice of the people must always remain supreme.\u201d The Editor's note: The alleged assassination attempt of Donald Trump is a developing story, and we\u2019ll update as we learn more.

And then in central France's Auvergne -- home to some of the nation's most beloved cheeses such as Saint-Nectaire, Cantal and Fourme d'Ambert -- she discovered the \"obligatory plate of cheese enjoyed after each meal\". These experiences set Bachurinskaya, alongside her husband, on a lifelong journey dedicated to making cheese, both before and after fleeing political repression in Belarus and resettling in Poland. \"We can't see our parents, or go back,\" said the 40-year-old from the city of Gomel in southeastern Belarus.\"But we can't think about that all of the time, we have to move forwards,\" she added.Bachurinskaya and her husband Alexei Kuchko, 42, remain in frequent contact with many other exiles, with whom they speak their native Belarusian rather than the Russian language preferred by the government back home.Hundreds of thousands have fled the country in the last few years following a crackdown on protests after President Alexander Lukashenko claimed victory in a 2020 presidential election that rights groups said was fraudulent.The couple arrived in Poland in late 2021 and are now settled on a farm in the village of Balazowka in the Carpathian Mountains, where they live alongside 37 sheep and five goats.The couple have been making cheese since ditching their office jobs in Minsk -- Bachurinskaya was a translator from Italian and Kuchko worked in marketing -- and settling in the northern Belarus countryside in 2015.Their efforts paid off with the duo specialising in farm-to-table artisanal cheese in a country where the agricultural sector remains largely linked to its collectivist past and where most farms are state-owned. Lukashenko -- a former collective farm director -- boasts that he has created a paradise for farmers. The reality on the ground and in the fields was very different, according to the couple. \"Let's imagine you want to buy French sheep in Belarus... If you're an average guy, no one will give you permission. If you're a friend of Lukashenko, you'll have everything,\" said Kuchko.Five years after they left the capital, Belarus was upended after Lukashenko claimed to have won 80 percent of the vote in polls, as he sought a sixth term as president. For weeks, tens of thousands took to the streets to protest against the alleged fraud. Under mounting pressure from the demonstrations, Lukashenko turned to Russian President Vladimir Putin for support, as he brutally cracked down on the protests. Opposition figures were rounded up and some allegedly tortured, while more than 300,000 of the country's 9.3 million residents fled abroad, according to UN figures. For months, Bachurinskaya and Kuchko feared arrest after campaigning for imprisoned opposition figure Viktor Babaryko. And then in late 2021, they decided it was time to leave the country.The couple managed to leave with their two horses by passing them off as racehorses, but parted with most of their livestock. Once across the border in Poland, they started to slowly rebuild after finding a piece of land and buying new sheep and goats. In their kitchen, they make around 10 varieties of cheese by hand, including one creation that Bachurinskaya says combines the \"piquant taste of goat cheese with the creaminess of brie\".The concoctions are later sold in the city of Krakow, a 90-minute drive away, or via their Instagram account, Krapacheese. Despite all the hardships, the couple say they remain grateful for what they have and the cheese they are able to share with the world. \"We have very little time to be sad,\" Bachurinskaya told AFP. \"And I'm happy about that.\"",

        "text": "The Pulitzer Prize-winning Associated Press photographer who captured the image of an injured, defiant Donald Trump waving his fist to a sea of supporters on Saturday after an apparent assassination attempt knew he had one task: to keep his camera on his subject. \u201cIt\u2019s a moment in history that you have to document, right?\u201d Evan Vucci told The Daily Beast by phone late Saturday, hours after he captured the shocking images. \u201cBeing a photographer, you have to, have to be there. I can\u2019t write about it later. I can\u2019t go back in time and get a redo. So you have to do your job.\u201d Vucci was one of the pool photographers on duty during Trump\u2019s late-day rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, one he perceived as a normal rally\u2014not unlike those he\u2019d covered before. Until, over his left shoulder, he heard gunshots. \u201cFrom there, I trained my lens on former President Trump,\u201d Vucci said. Thoughts of his safety? Didn\u2019t concern him. Thoughts of his surroundings? Irrelevant at that moment. All he cared about, he said, was what the conditions were to document history. \u201cWhat\u2019s going to happen next? What do I need to do? Where do I need to be? What is the light? What is the composition? So those are the things that starts to go through your head,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s very much in the mindset where you\u2019re just now doing your job.\u201d Videos captured Vucci racing toward the right side of the stage seconds after the shooting, as he believed it best to follow where the Secret Service agents were likely to escort Trump off the platform. \u201cThey stand them up, and then he starts pumping his fists to the crowd,\u201d Vucci said. \u201cAt that point you\u2019re just making sure that your composition is good and you\u2019re making the images that you need to make.\u201d Vucci\u2019s photos took the nation by storm, documenting a bloodied former president a week before he was set to secure the Republican nomination. His photos, along with those of peers such as New York Times veteran photographer Doug Mills and Getty Images\u2019 Anna Moneymaker, lit up all forms of news broadcasts and social media, a dark convergence of the virality of the digital age with the grim occasion of an assassination attempt on a U.S. leader. History has trained Vucci for such a moment, teaching him the patience and calm nature needed to remain steady when a scene takes a sharp, potentially violent turn. An AP photographer for about 21 years, he won a Pulitzer in 2021 for his breaking news coverage of the 2020 racial justice protests in Washington, D.C. after George Floyd\u2019s death, and he has covered wars, Washington, and almost everything in between. Vucci was also known for capturing the face of the Iraqi journalist who threw a shoe at President George W. Bush\u2014though not Bush ducking to avoid the shoe, a moment he\u2019s still frustrated by. \u201cBush ducking the shoe I never got because I was on the shoe thrower,\u201d he said. \u201cYou just want to do the best you can so people can look back on it and be like, \u2018Yeah, that was a moment in history.\u2019 And here we are.\u201d Vucci wasn\u2019t bothered by the rising conversation around his photos\u2019 political significance, which pundits online noted how the striking shot of a bloodied Trump displaying strength\u2014literally, in clenching his fist\u2014 could help tilt the election in his favor. \u201cI shoot politics for a living, man. Every single photo I take people are going to argue about,\u201d Vucci said with a laugh. \u201cI spend my life around a very highly polarized part of our society, so no matter what I do, people are gonna hate it. People are gonna love it. Listen, as long as everyone hates me equally, I\u2019m doing the job.\u201d That responsibility guided Vucci through the harrowing moments on Saturday, producing photos that will help drive political discourse through the election and be imprinted in the minds of Americans\u2014and likely history books\u2014for generations. \u201cI\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t let anyone down. I got a standard to hold,\u201d Vucci said. \u201cI got into journalism to, you know\u2014the idea is to inform the American public, and I hope that they can look at the photos and they can see what I saw that day.\u201d",

        "text": "By Michael Biesecker and Michael Kunzelman, Associated Press The U.S. Secret Service is investigating how a gunman armed with an AR-style rifle was able to get close enough to shoot and injure former President Donald Trump at a rally Saturday in Pennsylvania, a monumental failure of one the agency\u2019s core duties. The gunman, who was killed by Secret Service personnel, fired multiple shots at the stage from an \u201celevated position outside of the rally venue,\u201d the agency said. An Associated Press analysis of more than a dozen videos and photos taken at the Trump rally, as well as satellite imagery of the site, shows the shooter was able to get astonishingly close to the stage where the former president was speaking. A video posted to social media and geolocated by the AP shows the body of a man wearing gray camouflage lying motionless on the roof of a manufacturing plant just north of the Butler Farm Show grounds, where Trump\u2019s rally was held. The roof was less than 150 meters (yards) from where Trump was speaking, a distance from which a decent marksman could reasonably hit a human-sized target. For reference, 150 meters is a distance at which U.S. Army recruits must hit a scaled human-sized silhouette to qualify with the M16 assault rifle in basic training. The AR-15, like the shooter at the Trump rally had, is the semi-automatic civilian version of the military M16. The FBI early Sunday identified the shooter as Thomas Matthew Crooks, 20, of Bethel Park, Pennsylvania. The Secret Service didn\u2019t have anybody at a late-night news conference where FBI and Pennsylvania State Police officials briefed reporters on the shooting investigation. FBI Special Agent in Charge Kevin Rojek said it was \u201csurprising\u201d that the gunman was able to fire at the stage before he was killed. Members of the Secret Service\u2019s counter sniper team and counter assault team were at the rally, according to two law enforcement officials. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren\u2019t authorized to discuss details of the investigation. The heavily-armed counter assault team, whose Secret Service code name is \u201cHawkeye,\u201d is responsible for eliminating threats so that other agents can shield and take away the person they are protecting. The counter sniper team, known by the code name \u201cHercules,\u201d uses long-range binoculars and is equipped with sniper rifles to deal with long-range threats. U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas said his department and the Secret Service are working with law enforcement to investigate the shooting. Maintaining the security of presidential candidates and their campaign events is one of the department\u2019s \u201cmost vital priorities,\u201d he said. \u201cWe condemn this violence in the strongest possible terms and commend the Secret Service for their swift action today,\u201d Mayorkas said. \u201cWe are engaged with President Biden, former President Trump and their campaigns, and are taking every possible measure to ensure their safety and security.\u201c Calls for an investigation came from all sides. James Comer, a Kentucky Republican who is the House Oversight Committee chairman, said he contacted the Service Service for a briefing and called on Director Kimberly Cheatle to appear for a hearing. Comer said his committee will send a formal invitation soon. \u201cPolitical violence in all forms is unamerican and unacceptable. There are many questions and Americans demand answers,\u201d Comer said in a statement. U.S. Rep. Ritchie Torres, a New York Democrat, called for investigating \u201csecurity failures\u201d at the rally. \u201cThe federal government must constantly learn from security failures in order to avoid repeating them, especially when those failures have implications for the nation,\u201d Torres said. Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers, a Democrat, posted on X that he and his staff are in contact with security planning coordinators ahead of the Republican National Convention set to begin Monday in Milwaukee. \u201cWe cannot be a country that accepts political violence of any kind \u2014 that is not who we are as Americans,\u201d Evers said. The FBI said it will lead the investigation into the shooting, working with the Secret Service and local and state law enforcement. Attorney General Merrick Garland said the Justice Department \u201cwill bring every available resource to bear to this investigation.\u201d \u201cMy heart is with the former President, those injured, and the family of the spectator killed in this horrific attack,\u201d Garland said in a statement. \u201cWe will not tolerate violence of any kind, and violence like this is an attack on our democracy.\u201d Associated Press writers Colleen Long and Zeke Miller in Washington contributed to this report.",

From there, Mr. Smith, who is a local of Butler, said he witnessed the male shooter who fired rounds of shots into the rally, which struck the former president\u2019s right ear and injured three rally attendees, killing one. \u201cI had a direct line of sight, directly to the backside of that roof. And I saw a guy crawling up the roof\u2014bear-crawling up the roof\u2014with a rifle,\u201d Mr. Smith told The Epoch Times. He and his party saw the U.S. Secret Service nearby and tried to get their attention. \u201cWe could see them looking at us. I stood there for about one or two minutes, pointing at the guy on the roof. And the police were running around, down and around the bottom of the building,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we were like, \u2018Hey, man, there was a guy on the roof with a rifle.\u2019 And the police were just running around, don\u2019t know what they were doing. And the next thing you know, the guy crawled up to the peak and took about four shots. I don\u2019t know how many shots it was exactly. That\u2019s what we saw.\u201d He believes the Secret Service shot the same man that he saw. The Secret Service did report that it killed the suspected shooter who they described as having attacked from an elevated position outside the rally venue. The FBI, early on July 14, identified the man as Thomas Matthew Crooks, 20, of Bethel Park, Pennsylvania. The agency said the investigation remains active and ongoing. The shooting is being investigated as an attempted assassination. The FBI has not yet identified a motive. After the shooting, people started running. Mr. Smith, who was wearing a red \u201cTrump 2020\u201d visor, said it was chaos from that point. \u201cThere is no place for this in politics,\u201d he said. \u201cWe dislike Joe Biden, we are not out trying to harm him. There is no place for that. That\u2019s not America. That\u2019s not what people should be doing.\u201d Former President Trump was quickly removed from the stage, surrounded by Secret Service agents, and taken to a local hospital. He was later released and flew to New Jersey where he spent the night at his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey, according to The Associated Press.",

That breach was intentional. Well, that's treason, and that person goes to Guantanamo Bay,\" he said.On the other side of the political spectrum, Andzu came to Milwaukee to protest against the Republicans on Monday, but he too said he was shocked by the assassination attempt.However, the 29-year-old said he is wary that the aftermath will become \"political theater\" and a distraction against campaign issues.\"Whether it was an actual assassination attempt against the Republicans or just political theater, whatever it doesn't change the fact that people are dying, that America is collapsing,\" said Andzu, who only gave one name.Whatever their convictions, passers-by on the streets of Milwaukee agreed that the attack will play to Trump's advantage in the polls, despite his criminal conviction.\"We've just gone to another level as far as our support for Trump,\" Altherr said.\"Now there's going to be more people that are going to be supporting president Trump.\"",

The gunman did not have a criminal history reflected in Pennsylvania\u2019s public court records, and officials said they had not identified a motive. A voter-registration record showed that Crooks was registered as a Republican, though federal campaign-finance records show he donated $15 to the Progressive Turnout Project, a liberal voter turnout group, through the Democratic donation platform ActBlue in January 2021. Early on Sunday morning, law enforcement officers had closed down all roads leading toward the home of the suspect\u2019s family in Bethel Park, south of Pittsburgh and about an hour\u2019s drive from the site of the rally in Butler. Numerous relatives did not respond to messages seeking comment. Crooks was killed after he fired from \u201can elevated position\u201d outside the outdoor rally venue where Trump was speaking, according to the Secret Service. Law enforcement officials recovered an AR-15-type semiautomatic rifle near the body of a white man they believe was the gunman, according to two law enforcement officials. Crooks appears to have graduated in 2022 from Bethel Park High School, which has about 1,400 students, and received a $500 \u201cstar award\u201d that year from the National Math and Science Initiative, according to The Tribune-Review in western Pennsylvania. In an online recording of the 2022 graduation ceremony, Crooks can be seen crossing the stage to modest applause after his name is called out, a slender young man with glasses in a black graduation gown who briefly posed with a school official and accepted his diploma. \u2014\u2014\u2014 This article originally appeared in The New York Times.",

        "text": "BUTLER, Pa. (AP) \u2014 Former President Donald Trump was the target of an assassination attempt Saturday at a Pennsylvania rally, days before he was to accept the Republican nomination for a third time. A barrage of gunfire set off panic, and a bloodied Trump, who said he was shot in the ear, was surrounded by Secret Service and hurried to his SUV as he pumped his fist in a show of defiance. Trump\u2019s campaign said the presumptive GOP nominee was doing \u201cfine\u201d after the shooting, which he said pierced the upper part of his right ear. \u201cI knew immediately that something was wrong in that I heard a whizzing sound, shots, and immediately felt the bullet ripping through the skin. Much bleeding took place,\u201d he wrote on his social media site. The FBI early Sunday identified the shooter as Thomas Matthew Crooks, 20, of Bethel Park, Pennsylvania. The agency said the investigation remains active and ongoing. Secret Service agents fatally shot Crooks, who attacked from an elevated position outside the rally venue at a farm show in Butler, Pennsylvania, the agency said. One attendee was killed and two spectators were critically injured, authorities said. All were identified as men. The attack was the most serious attempt to assassinate a president or presidential candidate since Ronald Reagan was shot in 1981. It drew new attention to concerns about political violence in a deeply polarized U.S. less than four months before the presidential election. And it could alter the tenor and security posture at the Republican National Convention, which will begin Monday in Milwaukee. Organizers said the convention would proceed as planned. Trump flew to New Jersey after visiting a local Pennsylvania hospital, landing shortly after midnight at Newark Liberty International Airport. Video posted by an aide showed the former president deplaning his private jet flanked by U.S. Secret Service agents and heavily armed members of the agency\u2019s counter assault team, an unusually visible show of force by his protective detail. President Joe Biden, who is running against Trump, was briefed on the incident and spoke to Trump several hours after the shooting, the White House said. \u201cThere\u2019s no place in America for this type of violence,\u201d the president said in public remarks. \u201cIt\u2019s sick. It\u2019s sick.\u201d Biden planned to return to Washington early, cutting short a weekend at his beach home in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware. Many Republicans quickly blamed the violence on Biden and his allies, arguing that sustained attacks on Trump as a threat to democracy have created a toxic environment. They pointed in particular to a comment Biden made to donors on July 8, saying \u201cit\u2019s time to put Trump in the bullseye.\u201d Officials said the shooter was engaged by members of the U.S. Secret Service counterassault team. The heavily armed tactical team travels everywhere with the president and major party nominees and is meant to confront any active threats while other agents focus on safeguarding and evacuating the person at the center of protection. Law enforcement recovered an AR-style rifle at the scene, according to a third person familiar with the matter who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the ongoing investigation. An AP analysis of more than a dozen videos and photos from the scene of the Trump rally, as well as satellite imagery of the site, shows the shooter was able to get astonishingly close to the stage where the former president was speaking. A video posted to social media and geolocated by the AP shows the body of a person wearing gray camouflage lying motionless on the roof of a building at AGR International Inc., a manufacturing plant just north of the Butler Farm Show grounds where Trump\u2019s rally was held. The roof where the person lay was less than 150 meters (164 yards) from where Trump was speaking, a distance from which a decent marksman could reasonably hit a human-sized target. For reference, 150 meters is a distance at which U.S. Army recruits must hit a scaled human-sized silhouette to qualify with the M-16 rifle. The AR-15, like the shooter at the Trump rally had, is the semi-automatic civilian version of the military M-16. Asked at the press conference whether law enforcement did not know the shooter was on the roof until he began firing, Kevin Rojek, Special Agent in Charge of the FBI\u2019s Pittsburgh Field Office, responded that \u201cthat is our assessment at this time.\u201d \u201cIt is surprising\u201d that the gunman was able to open fire on the stage before the Secret Service killed him, he added. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, whose department oversees the Secret Service, said officials were engaged with the Biden and Trump campaigns and \u201ctaking every possible measure to ensure their safety and security.\u201d",

        "text": "BUTLER, Pa.\u2014An assailant fired several shots at former President Donald Trump during a rally on July 13, piercing the former president\u2019s right ear, killing a man in the stands, and critically injuring two others. The former president was airlifted to a nearby hospital and was in good health. His jet departed Pennsylvania minutes before midnight, according to a flight tracking website. A video later posted by one of his press aides shows the former president walking down the stairs to the tarmac in New Jersey. Secret Service personnel killed the attacker seconds after he fired a rifle from a nearby rooftop. The FBI has since identified the suspect as Thomas Matthew Crooks, 20, of Bethel Park, Pennsylvania\u2014about one hour\u2019s drive from the rally grounds in Butler to the north. The assassination attempt, the first such attack against a president or a presidential candidate since 1981, occurred days prior to the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, where the GOP plans to formally nominate former President Trump to challenge President Joe Biden in this year\u2019s presidential election. It was also the latest in an unprecedented, polarized campaign season that featured four indictments and a conviction for former President Trump, the conviction of the sitting president\u2019s son, Hunter Biden, and most recently, a campaign by some in the Democrat party to push President Biden out as leader of the Democrats in the 2024 race. Not long after the chaos erupted in Butler, warm wishes poured forth from friends and opponents at home and abroad. Former Presidents George W. Bush, Bill Clinton, and Barack Obama said they were relieved that former President Trump was safe, and condemned the attack. President Biden issued a written statement and briefly addressed the nation from Delaware. The president later spoke to his predecessor, according to the White House. \u201cThere\u2019s no place in America for this kind of violence. It\u2019s sick, it\u2019s sick,\u201d President Biden said at the emergency briefing room in Rehoboth, Delaware. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the reasons we have to unite this country,\u201d he said. \u201cWe cannot allow for this to be happening. We cannot be like this. We cannot condone this.\u201d The leaders of the United Kingdom, Canada, India, and Israel among many others, also wrote messages of support. Mr. Trudeau said he was \u201csickened\u201d by the shooting. \u201cIt cannot be overstated\u2014political violence is never acceptable,\u201d he wrote. \u201cMy thoughts are with former President Trump, those at the event, and all Americans.\u201d The former president\u2019s supporters and Republicans in Congress began to question the security arrangements for the event as more information surfaced about the assassin\u2019s location. The shooter was able to crawl on top of a roof in plain sight of several eyewitnesses who said they that had alerted law enforcement personnel minutes before the shots were fired. Greg Smith was one of several people listening to the rally from outside the Butler Farm Show grounds. From there, Mr. Smith of Butler said he saw the assailant crawling up the roof. \u201cI had a direct line of sight, directly to the backside of that roof, and I saw a guy crawling up the roof, bear-crawling up the roof, with a rifle,\u201d Mr. Smith told The Epoch Times. He and his party saw Secret Service agents and tried to get their attention. \u201cWe could see them looking at us. I stood there for about one or two minutes, pointing at the guy on the roof,\u201d Mr. Smith said. \u201cAnd the police were running around, down and around the bottom of the building. And we were like, \u2018Hey, man, there was a guy on the roof with a rifle.\u2019 And the police were just running around, [I] don\u2019t know what they were doing. And the next thing you know, the guy crawled up to the peak and took about four shots. I don\u2019t know how many shots it was exactly. That\u2019s what we saw.\u201d Kevin Rojek, the special agent in charge of the FBI\u2019s Pittsburgh field office, told reporters that the bureau\u2019s current assessment was that security personnel were unaware of the man on the roof until he began firing his rifle. \u201cIt is surprising\u201d that the assailant was able to fire as many rounds as he did, Mr. Rojek said. The FBI will lead the investigation into the attempted assassination, while state agencies will have domain over the killing of the bystander and the critical wounding of two others. In the hours following the shooting, social media was flooded with images from the attack, which was being live streamed. In one photo, the former president, bloodied and surrounded by Secret Service agents, raises a defiant fist toward the audience, taking the time to let them know he was ok as Secret Service agents worked to move the former president off the stage. Another photographer captured the long blur of a brass-colored bullet streaking through the air by the former president\u2019s head. \u201cGod protected President Trump,\u201d Sen. Marco Rubio, who is one of the top contenders for the vice presidential nomination, wrote on X. The Trump Campaign and the Republican National Convention confirmed in a statement that former President Donald Trump will appear in person at the Republican National Convention, which kicks off in two days in Milwaukee on Monday, July 15. She said she saw \u201ca little bit of blood\u201d on his left cheek, she told The Epoch Times. Then, when he turned his face the other way, she saw blood running down the right side. She said she felt relieved when he pumped his fist. Tom Chyb, a Butler resident, told The Epoch Times that he initially thought there were fireworks going off before he realized that shots had been fired. \u201cIt was shocking; it was ugly. Just too ugly to be true,\u201d he told The Epoch Times, as men in tactical gear ran past. Logan Reynolds, 27, of Erie, Pennsylvania, was at the very back of the crowd. When the shots rang out, there was an initial moment of uncertainty. But then, he said, a sea of people turned away from the stage and faced him. \u201cI saw over 1,000 faces of terror in one instant,\u201d he told The Epoch Times. Mr. Reynolds said the shooting made him sad, then angry, but said he felt better after hearing news reports that former President Trump had given a fist pump after getting up from behind the podium. Mr. Reynolds said he gathered a few people together on a bridge to wave Trump flags at passing motorists to bolster morale. The shooting represented someone \u201ctrying to take away the right for us to vote for who we want,\u201d he told The Epoch Times. \u201cThat person was undermining our Republic and our democracy.\u201d Mr. Reynolds said both he and his younger brother \u201chad a funny feeling\u201d about the area later identified as the spot where the gunman had positioned himself, as there were too few security guards there. \u201cWhy wasn\u2019t that building completely locked down? And why wasn\u2019t a sniper on every roof?\u201d Mr. Reynolds asked. State officials did not immediately name the victims of the attack to afford relatives time to contact their extended families. Rep. Ronny Jackson (R-Texas), a White House physician during the Trump administration, said a bullet grazed his nephew\u2019s neck at the Trump rally. His nephew was in an area designated for friends and family to the right of former President Donald Trump, Mr. Jackson said on Fox\u2019s Hannity show Saturday night. Mr. Jackson said that someone four or five rows behind his nephew was \u201ccritically injured.\u201d The shooting happened about 90 seconds after the crowd chanted, \u201cThank you, Trump!\u201d in response to Trump saying he could have been living a life of leisure on an island somewhere but felt obligated to run for president and help the nation. In a message to his supporters posted on Truth Social, the former president said he was shot with a bullet that \u201cpierced the upper part of my right ear.\u201d \u201cI knew immediately that something was wrong in that I heard a whizzing sound, shots, and immediately felt the bullet ripping through the skin,\u201d he said. \u201cMuch bleeding took place, so I realized then what was happening. GOD BLESS AMERICA!\u201d",

        "text": "Voters in at least six states will decide on abortion-related ballot measures this fall, in addition to five additional states that may join them if state officials determine the initiatives qualify for the ballot. Since the overturn of Roe v. Wade in 2022, many states have put restrictions on the controversial procedure, but abortion-rights activists have found success in reversing many of those limits through ballot measures. Ohio is the most recent state where voters weighed in on the abortion debate, with Issue 1 passing last year. This year, Colorado, Florida, Maryland, Nevada, New York, and South Dakota have confirmed abortion ballot measures, while Arizona, Arkansas, Missouri, Montana, and Nebraska have measures still waiting on confirmation. Here is where they stand: Arkansas The most recent developments have occurred in Arkansas, where earlier this week, Arkansas Secretary of State John Thurston rejected an abortion ballot measure, determining that the organizers behind the initiative failed to submit required paperwork proving they had explained the signature gathering requirements in Arkansas to the paid canvassers they used to collect them. They also failed to identify the paid canvassers by name. Arkansas\u2019s abortion laws restrict nearly all abortions in the state, making an exception only when the life of the mother is at risk. Americans United for Life rated the state, which reported zero abortions last year, \u201cthe most pro-life state\u201d of 2024. The ballot measure, backed by a group calling itself Arkansans for Limited Government, would prohibit laws restricting abortions before 18 weeks gestation, and creates exceptions for rape, incest, fetal anomaly, and life or health of the mother. Critics of the ballot measures note that including \u201chealth\u201d of the mother, as distinct from a threat to her life, opens the door wider for a doctor to allow abortions at any point during the pregnancy, including up until the moment of birth. Ballot measure organizers have vowed to fight Thurston\u2019s rejection of their initiative. Arizona Arizona also saw movement this week with its measure, which would establish a \u201cfundamental right\u201d to abortion until \u201cfetal viability,\u201d or the point at which the unborn child could theoretically survive outside the womb, generally considered around 24 weeks. It will also allow for late-term abortions if a doctor determines that the life of the mother is at risk or her physical or mental health is in danger. Current Arizona law limits abortion at 15 weeks. On Wednesday, organizers behind the expansive measure filed a lawsuit against Arizona officials who included the phrase \u201cunborn human being\u201d in the description of the ballot initiative on a voter information pamphlet. The lawsuit claims the language is not impartial or nonpartisan. Organizers want the phrase replaced with \u201cfetus,\u201d which is often used by abortion access advocates to diminish the humanity of the unborn. The word \u201cfetus\u201d is included as a preferred phrase in style guides advocated by abortion industry leaders, such as the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, and other abortion access advocates. \u201cThere is no way to avoid it,\u201d Republican Arizona House Speaker Ben Toma said. \u201cBecause using the word \u2018fetus\u2019 is partial, as well, for those of us on the pro-life side.\u201d While organizers submitted over 823,000 signatures for the ballot measure, officials still need to verify them for the initiative to be approved for the ballot. Montana Montana\u2019s ballot initiative, which would block government restrictions on abortion prior to \u201cviability\u201d and includes exceptions for the life or health of the mother, has been in some legal turmoil recently. This week, organizers sued Montana Secretary of State Christi Jacobsen after she decided the state needed to reject the signatures of \u201cinactive voters\u201d who signed the petition for the initiative to obtain ballot access. According to Montana law, those who miss two federal elections can have their voter registration become inactive. Jacobsen says the law requires signatories to be \u201cqualified electors,\u201d which she argues includes having an active voter status. Abortion is already legal in Montana until \u201cviability.\u201d Nebraska Nebraskans could see dueling abortion measures on their ballot in November, as organizers both in favor of abortion and against it say they have collected well over the number of signatures required to make the ballot. Like many other measures, the abortion-rights measure would enshrine access to abortion until fetal viability. The anti-abortion measure would enshrine current state law, which blocks the procedure after 12 weeks gestation with some exceptions. If both make the ballot, only the one that receives the most votes would become part of the state constitution. Colorado In a state where abortion is already legal up until the moment of birth, organizers in Colorado are seeking to enshrine that access in the state\u2019s constitution as well as allow the use of taxpayer dollars to fund the procedure. The petition has officially been approved for the ballot and requires the vote of 55% of the electorate to amend the constitution. Organizers for a counter-ballot initiative, which would have banned abortion in the state, failed to meet signature requirements. Florida Activists in Florida, which currently has a six-week gestational protection for the unborn, have secured a measure on the Sunshine State\u2019s ballot that would override the current restriction and allow for abortion at \u201cviability.\u201d Attorney General Ashley Moody initially challenged the term \u201cviability\u201d in the initiative language because of its vagueness, but the initiative made it on the ballot anyway. In order for it to be approved, 60% of voters in Florida would have to vote in favor of the expansive abortion access. Maryland Maryland state law allows abortion until \u201cviability,\u201d but organizers there are trying to enshrine access in the state\u2019s constitution. Abortion in Maryland is also legal after \u201cviability\u201d for fetal anomalies or if the mother\u2019s life or health are at risk. The measure has officially made the ballot, and it would establish a \u201cright\u201d to \u201creproductive freedom\u201d defined to include \u201cdecisions to prevent, continue, or end one\u2019s own pregnancy.\u201d That language could upend Maryland\u2019s already lenient abortion laws and allow the procedure up until the moment of birth. Nevada Voters in Nevada will be asked to decide whether they want to enshrine as a constitutional \u201cright\u201d access to abortion until viability. The measure, which was approved for the ballot in June, would allow for regulation of abortion after \u201cviability,\u201d but would create exceptions for life, physical health, or mental health of the mother. Nevada law already allows abortion up to 24 weeks gestation. South Dakota An initiate in South Dakota would create a trimester framework for the regulation of abortion, starting with a complete ban on any restriction to the procedure in the first trimester. In the second trimester, the state could \u201cregulate the pregnant woman\u2019s abortion decision and its effectuation only in ways that are reasonably related to the physical health of the pregnant woman,\u201d according to the language of the initiative, and a ban on the procedure would be allowed in the third trimester only if it provides exceptions for the life and health of the mother. Abortion is currently banned in South Dakota. Missouri Missouri currently restricts almost all abortions and provides limited exceptions for the procedure. It became the first state to enact such a comprehensive ban after the overturn of Roe, and the state law threatens doctors who facilitate abortions with felony charges. However, organizers in Missouri are attempting to expand access to the procedure up to \u201cviability\u201d and enshrine a \u201cright\u201d to \u201creproductive freedom,\u201d defined as \u201cthe right to make and carry out decisions about all matters relating to reproductive health care, including but not limited to prenatal care, childbirth, postpartum care, birth control, abortion care, miscarriage care, and respectful birthing conditions,\u201d in the state\u2019s constitution. Organizers have collected more than twice the required amount of signatures to make the ballot, but officials in Missouri have until July 30 to certify them before the initiative can officially be presented to voters. New York New York\u2019s abortion-related amendment is different from the others because it would add language to the state\u2019s bill of rights, barring the denial of rights based on \u201cethnicity, national origin, age, and disability\u201d or \u201csex, including sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, pregnancy, pregnancy outcomes, and reproductive healthcare and autonomy.\u201d CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER The measure was initially stricken from the ballot by a judge in upstate New York, but an appeals panel of judges restored it last month. New York currently allows abortion until \u201cviability.\u201d",

        "text": "Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin MadTree Brewing Holly Days, from Cincinnati, Ohio Photo Illustration: Brad Japhe Late last year, a panel of over two dozen category experts convened in Northern California in order to pore over (and pour through) some of the best beers on the planet. The annual gathering, known as the World Beer Competition, is run by the Tasting Alliance. If you\u2019re not already familiar with that organization, they\u2019re the same folks responsible for the San Francisco World Spirits Competition\u2014often regarded as that industry\u2019s preeminent judging. So, clearly they know how to foam up prestige within the adult beverage sector. Which bodes well for the talented craftspeople over at MadTree Brewing in Cincinnati, Ohio. Because the World Beer Competition has just named its Holly Days release the best India Pale Ale on the planet. The wintertime brew uses an adjunct of spruce tips to affect a poignant seasonality beyond the bitter base formed from Cascade, Chinook, Sultana and Eureka hops. It\u2019s not just some marketing gimmick, either. Crack open a can of the 6.8% ABV liquid and you\u2019ll detect a pronounced piney-ness in the aroma and across the palate. It\u2019s evocative of Christmas, to be sure, and also fits hand-in-glove with the resiny, citrus pith gliding off the precise hops recipe used for the brew. Ultimately, however, it might be the lengthy\u2014and unexpectedly\u2014complex finish that curried favor with the judges at the Tasting Alliance. It tickles the tongue with an initial tang, which is almost a misdirection since the parting flavor is a drying return to that prescribed piney-ness. And who doesn\u2019t love a good circle story? Especially one that can be shared for a retail price of $11 per six-pack. The only thing that hopheads have to complain about with Holly Days is that, as its name suggest, this is an offering that\u2019s only available during the festive season of November through January. In the meantime, if you\u2019d like to explore a comparable counterpart, the fermentation artisans at MadTree produce a year-round staple called Psychopathy. It\u2019s similar in profile, utilizing many of the same ingredients (minus those celebrated spruce tips, of course), and it\u2019s readily available for around $12 per six-pack.

Today\u2019s Highlight in History: On July 14, 1789, in an event symbolizing the start of the French Revolution, citizens of Paris stormed the Bastille prison and released the seven prisoners inside. Also on this date: In 1798, Congress passed the Sedition Act, making it a federal crime to publish false, scandalous or malicious writing about the United States government. In 1881, outlaw William H. Bonney Jr., alias \u201cBilly the Kid,\u201d was shot and killed by Sheriff Pat Garrett in Fort Sumner in present-day New Mexico. In 1912, American folk singer-songwriter Woody Guthrie was born in Okemah, Oklahoma. In 1933, all German political parties, except the Nazi Party, were outlawed by the government of Nazi Germany. In 1945, Italy formally declared war on Japan, its former Axis partner during World War II. In 1960, 26-year-old Jane Goodall first arrived at the Gombe Stream Reserve in present-day Tanzania to begin her study of the wild chimpanzees living there. In 2004, the Senate scuttled a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage. (Forty-eight senators voted to advance the measure \u2014 12 short of the 60 needed \u2014 and 50 voted to block it.) In 2009, disgraced financier Bernard Madoff arrived at the Butner Federal Correctional Complex in North Carolina to begin serving a 150-year sentence for his massive Ponzi scheme. (Madoff died in prison in April 2021.) In 2013, thousands of demonstrators across the country protested a Florida jury\u2019s decision the day before to clear George Zimmerman in the shooting death of Trayvon Martin. In 2015, world powers and Iran struck a deal to curb Iran\u2019s nuclear program in exchange for relief from international sanctions. In 2016, terror struck Bastille Day celebrations in the French Riviera city of Nice as a large truck plowed into a festive crowd, killing 86 people in an attack claimed by Islamic State extremists; the driver was shot dead by police. In 2020, researchers reported that the first COVID-19 vaccine tested in the U.S. boosted people\u2019s immune systems as scientists had hoped; the vaccine was developed by the National Institutes of Health and Moderna Inc. In 2022, the National Galleries of Scotland said a previously unknown self-portrait of Vincent Van Gogh was discovered behind another of the artist\u2019s paintings when experts took an X-ray of the canvas ahead of an upcoming exhibition.

        "text": "The U.S. High Speed Rail Association (USHSR) published a map outlining its proposal for a new 17,000-mile national high-speed rail network across the United States, which it claims will \"cut our carbon footprint by epic proportions.\"Under the plan, which the USHSR proposes to build in four stages, it would be possible to travel between Seattle, Washington; San Diego, California; Miami, Florida; and Boston, Massachusetts, entirely on 220-mile-per-hour high-speed rail lines.The past few years have seen a renaissance in high-speed rail interest across the United States, following decades of little activity. A number of lines are either proposed or under construction. Integrated high-speed rail networks already exist across much of Western Europe, Japan, and China, which, according to Statista, had a 25,000-mile-long network in 2021.The first stage of the new network proposed by the USHSR would see construction focused around seven regions, including lines connecting Dallas to San Antonio and Houston, Chicago to Minneapolis and Detroit, and New York City to Washington, D.C.This stage includes the completion of the California High-Speed Rail, a line already under construction that is intended to run between San Francisco and Los Angeles. It also proposes a line linking Las Vegas, Nevada, to Los Angeles, similar to a line currently being built that will connect Las Vegas to southern California.Also incorporated into this stage are plans to build a new high-speed rail line connecting Houston and Dallas in Texas, which President Biden endorsed in principle in April but has yet to receive full approval. Planning is also underway on a high-speed rail line linking Dallas to Fort Worth, though details remain vague at this stage.The second stage of the USHSR's plan would extend the lines built in the first stage, with the northeast corridor line going all the way up to Boston and Charlotte, North Carolina. The Texas line would be extended to the east and north via New Orleans and Nashville, linking up with the network built in the first stage around Chicago.A number of other lines built in the first stage would also be extended while new lines would be built linking Denver to Albuquerque, Kansas City and St. Louis and Oklahoma City to Tulsa.In the third stage, a line would be constructed linking the existing California and northwest network from Eugene, Oregon, to Sacramento, while Las Vegas would be linked to Dallas and Jackson, Mississippi, via another railway. A new line between Salt Lake City, Utah, and Denver is also proposed at this stage, along with expansions linking the northeastern network to Detroit and Montreal in Canada.Finally, the fourth stage of the USHSR proposal would include new lines linking Salt Lake City to existing networks via Seattle and Sacramento. Denver would be connected to Kansas City, Omaha, and Minneapolis, while Dallas would be linked to Memphis, St. Louis, and Louisville.Speaking to Newsweek about the plan, Andy Kunz, CEO of the USHSR, said: \"The Obama-Biden Administration set a goal of giving 80 percent of Americans access to high-speed rail within 25 years. Such nationwide access remains our goal.\"On its official website, the USHSR says the new network would \"revitalize our economy, reactivate our manufacturing sector, create millions of jobs, end our oil dependency, reduce congestion, create access to vast areas of affordable housing, and cut our carbon footprint by epic proportions.\"It continues: \"Powered by electricity, this system provides sustainable, affordable, safe mobility for all.\"The USHSR was founded in 2009 as a nonprofit organization to campaign for the construction of new high-speed rail networks across the U.S. It works with trade associations, manufacturers and engineering firms to lobby different levels of government in support of its plans.",

        "text": "President Biden\u2019s poor performance at the debate is only the latest in a series of gaffes and blunders, both physical and mental, that have many scratching their heads when thinking about his brain. There have been calls both within and without the Democratic Party for Biden to step aside; some fear that even if he wins the election, he might be in no condition to finish what he set out to do. Some declare him \u201ctoo old,\u201d and others are preoccupied with the likelihood of his having specific diseases that might explain his performance. Many have asked the president to reassure the public by taking a cognitive test, something he refuses to do. While spin doctors are unethically diagnosing at a distance on cable news outlets, respectable experts must remain silent, forbidden by the Goldwater Rule, a provision of the American Psychiatric Association\u2019s Principles of Medical Ethics, which restricts clinicians who have not personally evaluated a candidate from rendering public medical opinions. Health literacy might be useful, then, for civic education. The American people are asking if he is safe, or will be safe, to perform his duties as executive in chief. It\u2019s a question that is as much about competency (our assessment of performance) as it is about competence (a legal standing to make decisions on behalf of himself or others). Consider a similar scenario in which Sen. Diane Feinstein\u2019s competency was in question when she was confused at a budget vote and instructed by handlers to just say \u201caye,\u201d versus her competence in her own legal and financial affairs when her daughter activated power of attorney (over a sitting senator). Can someone who cannot govern themselves govern a nation? This same question is now core to the concerns challenging President Biden\u2019s campaign. To understand the situation, it\u2019s important to realize that someone\u2019s diagnosis doesn\u2019t necessarily predict anything about a person\u2019s function at any given moment \u2013 or for any given activity. Defenders of Biden are correct when they offer platitudes like \u201cage is just a number.\u201d Yes, age is just a number. Biology, however, is more than that. Maine has the oldest population by median age, but our people are built tough \u2013 just consider Virginia Oliver, of Rockland, the 104-year-old lobster lady. In medical practice, we often remark on whether or not a patient \u201clooks their stated age,\u201d because it tells us if their body is keeping up with them, or if time is outpacing their body. Those features of function are really what people are trying to ascertain about our president. We need to separate questions of what is going on (disease) from how well things are going on (function). The latter is what the president and his medical team should be addressing clearly and openly; it\u2019s the nearest we might get to an official statement about his competence and competency to carry out his duties. It is important to know in what ways, if any, he is compensating for impairments. So far, White House spokespeople have been cagey on just such information. Let me explain why disease and function are related but not always congruent domains, and why we should be demanding for more information about the latter. For example, the overaccumulation of two key proteins clumping together in the brain, with signs of shrinkage and damage in a particular pattern, are the criteria we use to diagnose a person with Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Alzheimer\u2019s disease is very common \u2013 about 1 in 9 people aged 65 years old or older has it (keep in mind the average age of the U.S. Senate is just shy of 65). A person may be diagnosed with Alzheimer\u2019s, but the range of functional impairment initially varies widely, as can rate of decline and activities most affected. Diagnoses like Alzheimer\u2019s and Parkinson\u2019s disease are categorical definitions (you have it or you don\u2019t). They tell you what is going on, but they don\u2019t tell you how a person is getting along. To evaluate performance, a different spectrum is used by doctors to grade a person\u2019s dysfunction \u2013 regardless of the source of that dysfunction. Subjective cognitive impairment means a person experiences cognitive difficulties noticeable to them (difficulties that have not caused them to give up specific activities of daily living like cooking, cleaning, driving, bill-paying and medication monitoring) but a doctor cannot find any evidence of impairment in cognitive tests. Mild cognitive impairment is when patients experience difficulties that also do not result in the suspension of any such activities, but doctors do find deficiencies on cognitive testing. And dementia is when there are difficulties that result in loss of one or more activities, and a doctor can find evidence of deficiencies on cognitive testing, too. That means a person can have Alzheimer\u2019s disease but not have dementia. It is true that some diseases of cognition, like Alzheimer\u2019s, do eventually progress to dementia, but the pace, duration and pattern of impairments can vary. So that\u2019s the first lesson to consider when approaching a candidate\u2019s cognition. The cognitive testing that pundits are clamoring for \u2013 and no one has clearly specified what kind of cognitive testing is being sought \u2013 might at most put the president in a functional category in the broadest sense. It still wouldn\u2019t automatically tell us anything about his function in specific tasks and domains. The kind of judgment call we\u2019re looking for is a judgment not about competence but of competency. No one is yet claiming the president is in such a state that he cannot govern his own affairs. He is competent in the medical-legal sense. However, there are certain self-determinations about one\u2019s performance that are competence-related with medical-legal consequences that doctors can directly determine, like the revocation of a driving license in those judged to be cognitively impaired drivers. Perhaps this is the closest metaphor for what the public is trying to get a sense of. Is President Biden safe to steer the country? His medical team may be the people best poised to alleviate or confirm the public\u2019s concerns and keep the country safe. It seems that is the exact information we are not getting any time soon \u2013 except indirectly. Biden and his medical team should work to produce a transparent and comprehensive articulation of his abilities as it pertains to the key tasks of the job he is pursuing and whether he can do those with or without occupational limitations. That is no different than what we would do for anyone \u201creturning to work\u201d or \u201cneeding to sign off\u201d in the workplace when concerns about their health or function are raised. There will be naysayers who will look for anything \u2013 from these doctors\u2019 political contributions to their medical schools \u2013 to discredit a positive or negative assessment. We don\u2019t need to know categorical diagnoses or functional classifications; those are private matters. We especially don\u2019t need raw results from cognitive tests. What will the public or pundits ever do with that? What we need addressed is competency \u2013 and a medical opinion of occupational limitations, if any. If Biden and his team refuse to lay the case out to a concerned American electorate, it\u2019s like a patient who refuses to take a driving test despite his family\u2019s concerns. The patient shows he has good judgment by giving up driving voluntarily \u2013 or proves his bad judgment with his refusal.",

        "text": "This month of VR gaming has been a wonderfully weird one as I venture through the Meta Quest 3's latest wacky puzzle games \u2013 and then work my frustration out in a high-octane VR battle royale. I finally got to experience what it's like to be in Taskmaster (it's harder than you think), how good a job I'd do if I needed to Hide The Corpse from the cops (not great, it turns out), and how quickly I can complete VR spot the difference and find Exit 8 (I actually did all right at this one). I then got a win in my first ever game of Population: One (my Fortnite skills did not carry over, I was hard carried and I'm not proud). So let's get into my my favorite Meta Quest 3 games and apps for July 2024. If you're looking for more recommendations, check out my picks from last month. Taskmaster VR If you\u2019ve never seen an episode of Taskmaster what are you doing with your life? It\u2019s fantastic. For the uninformed among you Taskmaster is a comedy game show originating from the UK \u2013 though the New Zealand and Australian iterations are equally superb from what I\u2019ve seen of them \u2013 in which five comedians compete to see who\u2019s the best at completing various odd objectives for the eponymous Taskmaster (Greg Davies). The Taskmaster\u2019s Assistant \u2013 Little Alex Horne \u2013 lends a hand by making sure no players break any rules while completing tasks (and sometimes provide assistance or snarky comments, or both). It\u2019s also a game show that makes everyone who watches it think they could do a far better job than the competitors. Taskmaster VR proves that\u2019s categorically untrue. This game gives you 15 challenges to take part in \u2013 as well as some bonus tasks, and a custom mode to create your own tasks \u2013 all set in the iconic Taskmaster House and theatre which are each judged and adjudicated by virtual recreations of Davies and Horne; it\u2019s literally like you\u2019re in the show. It even manages to deliver TM's brand of task twists that are equally exciting and frustrating \u2013 though there are plenty of Taskmaster VR tasks that require more hands-on, less thinky approaches. My only gripe is the controls can be finicky at times. It does kinda play into the show\u2019s themes, but I wouldn\u2019t complain if the motion controls were more precise. It\u2019s a critique I\u2019ve seen others levy at the title, too. Because of this, while I absolutely adore this game \u2013 and have had a lot of fun watching friends, family, and colleagues give it a go for themselves \u2013 it\u2019s probably only a must-play for Taskmaster fans. That\u2019s not to say TM newcomers won\u2019t also find something to love here, but it requires someone with the right attitude who\u2019s after delightfully silly fun rather than a player looking for a more serious and precise VR experience. Hide The Corpse Hide the Corpse is a wacky 1970s themed VR puzzle game in which you have one objective: hide Tom\u2019s dead body before the cops show up. Please, let me cook; this is such a good game. You have four minutes to find a hiding spot for Tom. Perhaps you\u2019ve managed to crack his safe and shove him in there, or simply stuffed him in a corner and covered him in random objects. Either way, if you successfully obscure Tom\u2019s corpse from the cops you\u2019ll be judged on several factors including how quickly you hid him, how many of his personal items you managed to dispose of, and how good a job you did wiping up your fingerprints. The game ranks each of the level\u2019s six hiding spots individually. So you\u2019re incentivized to replay the game to not only find every way to conceal Tom, but maximize your score for each attempt, too. I also kind of like how difficult it is to manhandle Tom. Initially it was frustrating, but it wouldn\u2019t be as challenging (or realistic) if you could simply throw him over your shoulder like he was a sack of feathers. The only downside is Hide The Corpse is still in early access so not everything has been completed yet. As such there are only three levels you can play so far: Tom\u2019s apartment, the garage, and an underwater level. That said, what we have so far is superb, and even in this unfinished state Hide The Corpse is well deserving of your attention. Plus, to sweeten the deal Hide The Corpse is discounted to a little over half of what its full-release cost will be if you buy it now in early access through Meta\u2019s App Lab. The Exit 8 VR The Exit 8 VR isn\u2019t your typical horror game \u2013 it\u2019s spot the difference. You must travel down a well-lit white corridor featuring a few posters, some maintenance doors and a lone commuter going in the opposite direction, and make a decision: should you go back the way you came or not? If everything looks like it should then you\u2019re fine to travel down the corridor, but if you notice an anomaly \u2013 perhaps a door handle that\u2019s out of place, odd markings on the floor, the commuter is grinning at you menacingly, or a river of blood is rushing towards you \u2013 then you have to turn around and go back the way you came. Every correct decision gets you one step closer to Exit 8\u2019s staircase, though any mistake sets you back to square one. Playing The Exit 8\u2019s looping scenario it\u2019s impossible to not grow paranoid as you begin to second-guess every decision you make \u2013 especially when you realize you\u2019ve made an error, but have no clue what anomaly you missed. And you can\u2019t spend forever analyzing every aspect of the room to guarantee you\u2019re correct because if the commuter turns the corner before you do you\u2019ll also be reset. But there\u2019s a determination that\u2019ll grip you, too. Every time I put Exit 8 down I found I was back a few hours later to give it another try and make my escape (which I\u2019m proud to report I did, with a plaque also alerting me that I\u2019d seen every anomaly for a double-barreled game completion). It is fairly short, but also very replayable as even if you know all the anomalies they\u2019re not always the easiest to spot. It\u2019s also not at all pricey making it an exceptionally affordable VR horror puzzle game that is certainly worth the cost of entry. P.S. While The Exit 8 can feature jumpscares, they're well-telegraphed and avoidable if you turn around and leave \u2013 dodging the anomaly \u2013 so you shouldn\u2019t be terrified of cheap frights in this thriller. Population: One This month I also played the Meta Quest 3\u2019s essential battle royale Population: One, with BigBox VR\u2019s Eric Morrill taking me through the title\u2019s recently added Phoenix Royale mode. He explained that Phoenix Royale is a more approachable way to play a battle royale \u2013 such as giving players some auto respawns at the beginning of the match so they aren\u2019t forced to return to the game queue if they\u2019re downed in the first few minutes. I\u2019ve played a lot of battle royales in my time \u2013 my first paid journalism gig was a dedicated battle royale writer covering titles like Fortnite \u2013 and while modes like this aren\u2019t what the hardcore fans say they want, I\u2019ll be the first to admit that these more forgiving options are perfect when you\u2019re looking to have a less stressful evening of gaming with your squad. Though that\u2019s not to say Phoenix Royale is an \u2018easy mode.\u2019 Players can buy weapon buffs and other upgrades that make them more deadly. Also, while you do respawn you lose all your gear (so if you aren\u2019t careful your losses can snowball), and with Population: One\u2019s climbing mechanic you always have to watch out for a player unexpectedly claiming the high ground and gunning you down. Plus, if you are looking for a different game style, Population: One still has its more classic battle royale and other game modes to explore. Throw in Population: One\u2019s solid gunplay, its varied map designs that offer a suite of engaging battlegrounds, the adrenaline boost that every battle royale is juiced up with, plus the fact it\u2019s entirely free to play, and you\u2019ve got a great VR game on your hands. If you haven't played it already there\u2019s no reason you shouldn\u2019t at least give it a try.",

        "text": "Jaime De Simone knew Passamaquoddy basketmaker Jeremy Frey had blue ribbons in his studio and collectors all over the world. But in 2021, when she was working as a curator at the Portland Museum of Art, she accompanied him to the prestigious Santa Fe Indian Market in New Mexico. What she witnessed there, she said, was \u201ccelebrity status.\u201d \u201cI quickly was observing how he was positioning himself and how well established he was on a national scale,\u201d said De Simone, who is now the chief curator at the Farnsworth Museum of Art in Rockland. \u201cPeople were flocking to his booth. People lined up before it even opened. By 9 a.m., people were there wanting to purchase all of them. I was in awe.\u201d Frey has been making baskets for more than two decades. Recently, he shot onto the contemporary art scene. Last year, Karma Gallery in New York started representing his work. This summer, the Portland Museum of Art is presenting \u201cWoven,\u201d an exhibition that will travel to venues such as the Art Institute of Chicago. It is not only his first solo show in a fine art museum \u2013 it is the first for any Wabanaki artist. But it was in 2011 that Frey won Best in Show in Santa Fe and at the Heard Museum Guild Indian Fair and Market in Phoenix in the same year, a nearly unheard-of feat. And basketry is the oldest art form practiced in Maine. The precise weaves and mesmerizing shapes in the gallery today raise the question: Why did this recognition take so long? \u201cThere\u2019s been a lack of respect for a long time,\u201d said Theresa Secord, the founding director of the Maine Indian Basketmakers Alliance and a longtime friend of Frey. \u201cIt\u2019s funny because I\u2019ve served on boards for 40 years and sometimes been the only Native American in the room. It\u2019s just amazing now there\u2019s so much interest in Native American art, and I\u2019ve been getting commissions at museums that wouldn\u2019t look at one of my baskets 10 years ago. I can\u2019t really explain it, but I will say, as far as our basketry, Jeremy himself has a lot to do with that.\u201d One basket, titled \u201cNavigating Tradition\u201d (2023), was first displayed in a solo exhibition for Frey at Karma. The outside is undyed ash in a simple woodland style. The inside is dyed in vibrant hues of red and purple, another basket entirely. \u201cOne of the things I\u2019ve been trying to do as far as the way I put myself in the world is less about traditional basketmaking and more as a contemporary artist, right?\u201d Frey said. \u201cBecause I did that for years, you know. But neither one of them is mutually exclusive.\u201d PAVING HIS WAY Frey, 45, grew up in Indian Township in a household where money was tight. \u201cOur toys were like a pencil and paper, art supplies, a little jackknife to carve things with,\u201d he said. \u201cThose were my games, really. If I was to play a game, I\u2019d draw it.\u201d He worked in restaurants when he got older, and he struggled with drugs and alcohol. When he came home to get away from the partying, his mother was relearning basketry from an elder in the community. Their family had deep ties to the tradition \u2013 Jeremy is the seventh generation to practice weaving \u2013 but he had never tried it. Gal Frey suggested that he start, and he found something he needed. \u201cComing out of drug addiction and a hard life, I needed some meditation,\u201d he said. Traditionally, makers harvest their own materials. The ash tree is sacred \u2013 and endangered by the emerald ash borer. Hunting for a healthy tree is a deeply rooted tradition, and the location of such a grove is a tightly held secret. Years ago, the first time Frey cut a tree himself, he chose the wrong kind. His uncle finally decided to teach him the trade. \u201cThat\u2019s what finally motivated him to take me into the woods,\u201d Frey said with a chuckle, \u201d \u2018No nephew of mine \u2026 \u2019 \u201d Founded in 1993, the Maine Indian Basketmakers Alliance set out to preserve the art of ash and sweetgrass basketry. Secord first met Frey in 2002 at a workshop on the reservation at Pleasant Point. His mother asked if her son could pound and split ash wood in exchange for $50 for gas money to get to the workshop. Secord says now that she wrote his first artist paycheck that day. The alliance would be critical to Frey as he built his career; Secord was the one who nominated him for the United States Artists Fellowship he received in 2010, when he was the youngest artist to ever win the award at 32. But most impressive to her is the way Frey got to this point without the traditional networks that some build in formal art school. \u201cIf you got an MFA, you have professors who are already pushing you to have shows in museums,\u201d Secord said. \u201cYou probably had a senior show for your BFA and all these connections. Those were available to other artists and not to Jeremy. He had to pave his way.\u201d STANDING OUT At markets, Frey would visit every table and study every basket. He set a goal: \u201cI would try to make something no one had seen before.\u201d \u201cI thought to myself, \u2018If I\u2019m going to try and do this for a living, I have to stand out,\u2019 because this was the place where you sell them,\u201d Frey said. In 2009, Frey went to the Santa Fe Indian Market for the first time with the Maine Indian Basketmakers Alliance. It is the largest Indigenous arts market in North America and also includes jewelry, pottery, textiles, paintings, and sculptures. He couldn\u2019t enter his work in the juried competition because he came to the market with a nonprofit, and the following year, he skipped it out of frustration. In 2011, he returned \u2013 and won the top prize, the first time a basket had done so in the market\u2019s long history. Today, ribbons of many colors are tacked onto a ceiling beam in Frey\u2019s studio near Bangor. Andrew Hamilton is the associate curator of art of the Americas at the Art Institute of Chicago, the next destination for \u201cWoven\u201d in October. He first encountered Frey\u2019s work in the Southwest and has judged his baskets in competitions. Even his largest works, he said, have an extraordinary level of detail. \u201cHis pieces just, in fact, sort of puzzled me the first time I saw one of his baskets because it was so intricate and had so many layers and so many woven structures,\u201d Hamilton said. \u201cI was like, \u2018How does he do that?\u2019 I\u2019m someone who does a lot of research, and I think I\u2019m pretty good at puzzling out how something woven is made. His work is so intricate and astounded me.\u201d The exhibition includes baskets spanning Frey\u2019s career. Early pieces from his mother\u2019s own collection show a fine weave, a technique that Secord said dates back 100 years but was no longer common when Frey started using it. Today, the precise technique features even in Frey\u2019s larger baskets and is a common thread in the show. Another hallmark of Frey\u2019s work is braided ash wood and cedar bark. Secord said she knows of no one else who had done this painstaking detail before now. A number of baskets include designs made of porcupine quills, a skill he also first learned from his mother. \u201cHe\u2019s making unprecedented design innovations within the art form that previous generations of Wabanaki basket makers had not,\u201d said Ramey Mize, assistant curator of American art at the Portland Museum of Art. \u201cSo there\u2019s a lot of novelty and experimentation, but he always comes back to the foundational principles of Wabanaki basketry.\u201d MUSEUM RECOGNITION The going rate for a good basket used to be $30. For decades, weavers just tried to sell enough in a month to cover the electric bill. The boldest elders set prices at $100 or even $125. When Frey started to develop a following, Secord said his prices caused some tension in the community. Younger basket makers traditionally set prices lower than their teachers as a sign of respect. But Secord said he has since helped increase the market so baskets are now getting fairer prices. Frey would not say what he sells his baskets for now, but Secord said others are able to charge four or even five figures at markets and for commissions. His mentor said even she raised her eyebrows a bit at his ambition over the years. \u201cI thought to myself, \u2018Good luck with that. This kid is good, but what is he thinking, really?\u2019 And by god, he\u2019s done it,\u201d Secord said. Mize said Frey saw his career take off out West in part because buyers and institutions in Maine had long overlooked this art form. \u201cBasketry and Indigenous art has been subject to stereotype and bias by the quote-unquote fine art world that seeks to instate really arbitrary divisions between quote-unquote craft and quote-unquote art,\u201d Mize said. \u201cBaskets were sold as a means of survival by Wabanaki people in order to safeguard this deeply important cultural tradition but also as income to survive post colonization. So a lot of Mainers saw these works in the context of these markets that would spring up on tourist routes in Bar Harbor and other coastal resort areas. They saw them in the sphere of souvenirs or curios, as a keepsake of your travels. I think that\u2019s why Jeremy wasn\u2019t as legible to Mainers for a long time.\u201d For years, Wabanaki art was exhibited mostly in ethnographic museums, such as the Abbe Museum in Bar Harbor. In 2015, Frey and Secord were among the basket makers invited to display their work at the Portland Museum of Art biennial for the first time. In 2019, Colby College Museum of Art hosted an exhibition titled \u201cW\u00edw\u0258nikan \u2026 the beauty we carry,\u201d which for the first time included Wabanaki curators and consultants. Secord, who now sits on the boards for both, said she sees museums today making a greater effort to show and acquire work by underrepresented artists, including those from Indigenous communities. The 50 or so baskets in \u201cWoven\u201d came not only from private collectors but also from major museums. Some, such as the National Museum of the American Indian in Washington, D.C., focus exclusively on Indigenous people and objects. Others have a fine art focus, such as the Farnsworth Art Museum in Rockland and the Smithsonian American Art Museum. \u201cA museum acquisition signifies validation in your practice,\u201d De Simone said. \u201cWe wanted to make it front and center that he\u2019s in the Smithsonian, Bowdoin, Colby, the Denver Art Museum.\u201d NEW GOALS \u201cWoven\u201d grew out of a conversation De Simone had with Frey in 2021 during that trip to Santa Fe. She had seen how far he had taken his career already, so she asked him, \u201cWhat are your goals?\u201d \u201cHe starts talking about how he wants to push his practice outside of baskets,\u201d she said. He wanted to make a video. He wanted to try prints. He wanted to be represented by a commercial gallery. De Simone brought those goals to the Portland Museum of Art and began planning his first solo show. She left the museum in 2022 for her current position at the Farnsworth but remained connected to the project. Mize helped bring the exhibition to the finish line. \u201cWoven\u201d includes a short and striking video, as well as a series of relief prints made with woven ash. One piece \u2013 \u201cCaesura\u201d (2023) \u2013 is a sculpture built into the gallery wall, a sort of inverted basket with a kaleidoscopic effect. \u201cHe needs a new set of goals right now because he\u2019s already accomplished all the ones he articulated in 2021,\u201d De Simone said. \u201cI hope he can figure out what that means for him, whether he\u2019s going to maintain that pace. Sometimes artists need to build in a moment of self reflection.\u201d On a hot summer day, Frey sat in his cool studio and split ash into thin strips. A shelf on the back wall was full of basket forms Frey made himself; an upside-down work-in-progress waited nearby. While many prominent artists have studio assistants, Frey is too much of a perfectionist to cede most tasks to someone else. He does have an apprentice now \u2013 Caleb Hoffman, Secord\u2019s son. He cannot keep up with the demand for his work, even as the gallery now manages his business. He misses personal connections at markets but doesn\u2019t miss negotiating prices there. It\u2019s all a little surreal, he said, like something out of a movie. \u201cThere\u2019s certain parts of it where you have imposter syndrome,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd there\u2019s other parts where you look around and think, \u2018This is happening right now. People aren\u2019t faking this. These aren\u2019t fake reviews. You\u2019re in Manhattan with an ancient craft that your family has done for seven generations.\u2019 That was amazing.\u201d",

        "text": "When national events overwhelm us, sometimes all we can do is act locally to try to change things in a small way. Nine years ago, I met with several people from my local Jewish community who were dismayed by state and national leaders demonizing immigrants. We wanted to find a way to respond. We came up with a simple idea: Match local volunteers with recently arrived asylum seekers. The volunteers would serve as mentors, helping them find resources and navigate challenges. We decided to focus on asylum seekers because they are the most vulnerable immigrants; they are totally dependent on public assistance until they get work permits, and there is no guarantee they will be allowed to stay here in the long term. We called our effort Welcoming the Stranger. From the outset, we were an informal and non-sectarian program, run by volunteers. The program grew exponentially after President Trump was elected. Many people were then searching for a way to make a difference. Our program provided that. My own mentoring experience began in 2016, at our program\u2019s first Thanksgiving dinner. I met a single mother who I will call Gloria. Gloria is the same age as my younger daughter, and they share a flair for fashion. Gloria fled an abusive partner in her home country in central Africa. She and her two young children were living in a Portland shelter at that time. Gloria spoke only a little English, and my junior-high French was barely useful. We relied on Google Translate at first, trying to make sense of its often hilarious gobbledygook. Gloria is a resourceful person, and she took full advantage of what was offered. When her family came to visit me, she brought over laundry to wash, thus saving her money for other needs. Her daughter and son played with the toys that my friends donated. They helped me in the garden and, come July, proudly dug up the potatoes they had planted. Although we celebrated when Gloria found an apartment, it was a sketchy place, infested with bedbugs and cockroaches. When Gloria was hired by a temp agency, she had to scramble to arrange child care. I helped her apply for a state day care subsidy, which required jumping through several hoops. Whenever I ran into a problem that I couldn\u2019t solve, I turned to others in Welcoming the Stranger for help. Our volunteer base includes experts on immigration and social services. Local legislators helped resolve some bureaucratic snafus. Even Rep. Chellie Pingree\u2019s office got involved. When we learned that Gloria\u2019s ex-partner was threatening the family, Pingree\u2019s office helped flag his passport should he try to enter the country. As Welcoming the Stranger grew, we started getting small donations that Temple Beth El managed for us. That money helped cover mentees\u2019 expenses, such as security deposits or trips to immigration court. We hired a wonderful organizer, Amy Titcomb, to manage daily operations. In 2022, we handed over the oversight for the program to the immigrant-run Maine Association of New Americans. Eight years later, I marvel at how far Gloria has come. A long time has passed since she had to wait in line for hours at the Portland General Assistance office. These days, she asks me for advice about how to invest her 401(k). With little formal schooling, Gloria has mastered everyday English \u2013 and she crushes it on American slang. After a few years as a temp, she found a permanent job with a major retailer. They keep trying to make her a manager, but she resists because she wants a flexible schedule to be available for her kids. These days, she lives in a subsidized apartment in a nice neighborhood. Gloria and her children have become part of my family. They call me Mami, a term of affection for an older woman. I cheered in the audience when each child graduated from elementary school. As we head into another election where immigrants once again are being demonized, I am heartened to think about what Welcoming the Stranger has accomplished. The program currently has 67 active matches, plus 281 completed matches (people like Gloria and I, who stay connected, mainly as friends). The asylum seekers in the program are filling essential jobs in our community and raising children who will be our future leaders. It has been one of the great privileges of my life to help Gloria and her children make their way in this country. God bless the America that made that possible.",

        "text": "I stopped watching presidential debates after I stopped drinking; I find the stress and frustration to be an unnecessary and avoidable trigger for cravings. But I saw enough of the most recent debate to know that President Biden didn\u2019t have a great time. And now the Democrats are in disarray (as usual), arguing about whether he should stay in the race, drop out, resign or plant his brain into a robot (I might be the first pundit to suggest this particular course of action). In my time working in health care, I\u2019ve seen that people age very differently. Like many elements of life, age exists on a spectrum. Some folks lose mental capacity in their 60s. Others remain independent, in shape and functional well into their 90s. Heck, my Uncle Tim\u2019s mom, Mrs. Lamar, was 102 when she passed away and, other than being fairly deaf, would have been perfectly capable of running the country. I can imagine her picking up the phone with France or England and asking them why they don\u2019t call anymore \u2013 and when they are coming to visit. Additionally, it\u2019s entirely possible to be perfectly intelligent and in possession of all your mental faculties while being unable to speak. It happens to people who suffer from aphasia after a stroke, for example. I do not care that Joe Biden is old. With age, often (not always) comes wisdom. I certainly do not care that he stutters. I don\u2019t even care that he loses his train of thought or makes low-grade word-swap mistakes. I do that all the time. Just this morning, I forgot to put coffee in the coffee maker and dripped myself a nice pot of hot water. I\u2019m 31 years old. There are a lot of things I have beef with Biden about. I don\u2019t like how he keeps giving Israel military aid even though our ally is pretty clearly using that support to terrorize civilian populations. I don\u2019t like how wishy-washy he is about protecting abortion access. I\u2019m pissed off that the Supreme Court just handed the office of the president a blank check for wielding executive power, and instead of using it to help average Americans (i.e., unilaterally lowering the Medicare eligibility age) or even just for silly things (declaring the wild turkey to be our national bird, per Benjamin Franklin\u2019s wishes), he\u2019s twiddling his thumbs. \u201cReelect me and I\u2019ll restore Roe v. Wade.\u201d My brother in Christ, you are literally the most powerful person in the country. Do something now. The presidency is a weird job. You\u2019re the United States\u2019 main representative on the world stage and are solely in charge of the country\u2019s nukes and, at the end of the day, in what is largely an HR or management position. The president appoints all sorts of heads of federal branches and agencies. So for me, it\u2019s not about Trump or Biden on their own. It\u2019s about who all they would put in charge of our government. Have you read about Project 2025, the conservative plan devised by the Heritage Foundation and several of Trump\u2019s presidential appointees, designed to hit the ground running on Day 1 of a new Trump \u2013 or any conservative Republican\u2019s \u2013 presidency? It\u2019s a common misconception that Republicans want a smaller government. The party does not. Republicans may want smaller government for themselves and their various rich donors, but they want a bigger government to use as a hammer against Americans who aren\u2019t living the way they want them to. Because of federal environmental regulations, my dog can safely go swimming in the Kennebec River within eyesight of the Bath Iron Works dry dock. If you think that General Dynamics keeps its chemicals out of our water supply due to the goodness of their hearts or the invisible hand of the market, then I have a bridge in Brooklyn to sell you. I don\u2019t want to turn the keys to my country\u2019s government over to people who would profit from its destruction or use it as a tool to bludgeon me into living according to their standards.

        "text": "It\u2019s easy to stay focused like a laser on U.S. politics right now, but we\u2019re not the only ones having elections this year. You may see analysts summarizing global trends and attempting to apply them to U.S. politics. That\u2019s a fool\u2019s errand in multiple ways. For one, even though it might seem like there are some obvious global trends lately, it\u2019s easy to find exceptions to them. For another, the U.S. is unique in many ways. We\u2019re the largest democracy in history to use a presidential system (it\u2019s why we have an Electoral College), and third parties and independent candidates have a much smaller role in our politics. One common refrain is that populist conservatives (some with leaders who have authoritarian tendencies) have been particularly successful lately. Those making this argument point to figures like Viktor Orban in Hungary, Recep Erdo\u011fan in Turkey and Benjamin Netanyahu in Israel. If these populist conservatives (among others) have been able to consolidate support in their country, is that a sign conservatives will be ascendant in the United States as well? Well, no. Despite all the characterizations of these leaders by the media, they still have to regularly face elections. Erdo\u011fan and Orban both had relatively narrow margins in their last elections. Erdo\u011fan needed a runoff to get reelected, and even then it was with only 52%, while Orban was held to similar numbers \u2013 although both won far more parliamentary seats thanks to gerrymandering. Netanyahu, meanwhile, had to roll back his planned judicial reforms in the face of mass protests and looks set to lose the next election, thanks in large part to the war in Gaza. Elsewhere, the conservative Law and Justice Party recently lost power in Poland, the Tories were trounced in the U.K. and the National Rally unexpectedly came in third in French elections. So, no, conservatives are not ascendant globally. Even if an elected leader has authoritarian tendencies, they\u2019re able to be defeated as long as the democratic structure remains intact. In all of the countries mentioned above, conservatives were often helped by a divided and/or inept opposition. What about an anti-incumbent mood, then? After all, the Tories lost power in the U.K. after 14 years. In France, President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s ruling centrist party came in second to the far left. This theoretical trend might be slightly more accurate, but it\u2019s still far from universal: In elections to the European Parliament, the center-right coalition held on to power. Similarly in Belgium, the incumbent party retained power, while in Finland, the president\u2019s former party, centrist conservatives, won another presidential election. There was a mixed result in South Africa; the ANC, which had ruled since the end of apartheid, lost its majority for the first time but retained the presidency under a coalition government. In Mexico, the president\u2019s chosen successor won easily. So, apparently, not all incumbents, or incumbent parties, need to be walking on eggshells worldwide. Another perceived theme, one closely tied to those mentioned above, is the upending of traditional party systems. In Italy, the Brothers of Italy \u2013 long considered an extremist nationalist party \u2013 was swept into power in 2022, upstaging the traditional conservative party. In France, the two-party system has been demolished twice: first by centrist president Macron\u2019s party and various alliances, then again by the National Rally and their opponents just last week. In England, amid the sweeping victory by Labour, minor parties (other than the Scottish National Party) did relatively well. Minor parties have done well globally lately, but they mostly haven\u2019t upended the left-right dynamic \u2013 just given it a facelift. Unfortunately, we\u2019re not likely to see the collapse of the two-party system in the U.S. any time soon. Even if most of these trends were accurate, they wouldn\u2019t be as applicable to the U.S. Anti-incumbent sentiment might be bad for President Biden, but as a former president, Donald Trump is hardly an outsider. The rise of conservative populism might help Trump, but it also motivates his opponents. Even as we take a look at global trends to see if they have any impact on the U.S., it\u2019s important to remember that our system is unique \u2013 and that this election, with two presidents running against one another, is going to be tough to categorize in a global context.

        "text": "PARIS \u2014 Paris is hosting an extra-special guest for France\u2019s national holiday Sunday \u2014 the Olympic flame lighting up the city\u2019s grandiose military parade for Bastille Day. Just 12 days before the French capital hosts exceptionally ambitious and high-security Summer Games, the torch relay is joining up with thousands of soldiers, sailors, rescuers and medics marching in Paris beneath roaring fighter jets to mark Bastille Day. While people around France mark the day with concerts, parties and fireworks, here\u2019s a look at what the holiday\u2019s about, and what\u2019s different this year: What does Bastille Day celebrate? On July 14, 1789, revolutionaries stormed the Bastille fortress and prison in Paris, heralding the start of the French Revolution and the end of the monarchy. The holiday is central to the French calendar, with events across the country. It aims to embody the national motto of \u2018\u2018liberty, equality and fraternity,\u2019\u2018 though not everyone in France feels the country lives up to that promise. The Paris parade is the holiday\u2019s highlight. This year, it\u2019s paying tribute to those who freed France from Nazi occupation 80 years ago, with a re-enactment of the D-Day landings of June 6, 1944, and a display of emblems of the 31 countries whose troops contributed to the liberation. About half are African nations that were under French colonial rule during World War II. Who takes part? Some 4,000 people and 162 horses will march in the tightly choreographed show, among them units that served in NATO missions in eastern Europe, against Islamic extremists in the Sahel, protecting French territories in the South Pacific and global shipping corridors. They\u2019re joined this year by three German officers from a cross-border brigade. The ornamental uniforms are rich in symbolism \u2013 most notably those of the French Foreign Legion sappers, with long beards, leather aprons and axes from their original role as route-clearers for advancing armies. Overhead, 65 aircraft will fly in formations, including a British Typhoon fighter alongside French Mirages and Rafales, rescue helicopters and aircraft used in missions from Afghanistan to Mali or international drug busts. President Emmanuel Macron and dozens of dignitaries will preside over it all. These are scaled-back numbers compared to previous years, because of Olympics security measures. Around 130,000 police are deployed around France for the holiday weekend. What\u2019s the political context? This year\u2019s Bastille Day offers Macron a moment of distraction from political turmoil he unleashed with snap elections that weakened his pro-business centrist party and his presidency. The result left a deadlocked parliament with no one clearly in charge. The prime minister could leave office within days, while the left-wing alliance that won the most seats is struggling to agree on a proposed replacement. Meanwhile, Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine is threatening Europe\u2019s security. At a meeting with military leaders Saturday, Macron said France will keep up support for Ukraine and called for higher defense spending next year because of \u2018\u2018approaching threats.\u2019\u2018 What\u2019s different this year? The Olympic torch relay reaches Paris just in time. The parade wraps up with the arrival of the flame, escorted by riders on horseback, 25 torchbearers, and cadets forming the shapes of the Olympic rings. Usually, the parade travels from the Napoleon-era Arc de Triomphe to the Concorde plaza, where France\u2019s last king and queen were beheaded. This year, Concorde has been transformed into a huge Olympic venue for breakdancing, skateboarding and BMX. So the parade route heads to the Bois de Boulogne park on the city\u2019s edge instead. Olympic venue construction around the Eiffel Tower means spectators can\u2019t gather beneath the monument to watch its annual fireworks show, either. After its Bastille Day appearance, the torch relay will swing by Notre Dame Cathedral, the historic Sorbonne university and the Louvre Museum before heading to other Paris landmarks Monday.",

        "text": "HONG KONG -- Global leaders have expressed concern Sunday over an assassination attempt targeting former U.S. President Donald Trump at a rally in Pennsylvania that left one attendee dead and critically injured two others, with many condemning the violence that shocked the world. Trump\u2019s campaign said the presumptive Republican nominee was doing \u201cfine\u201d after being whisked off the stage though the shooting pierced the upper part of his right ear. The Secret Service said it killed the suspected shooter who attacked from an elevated position outside the rally venue. U.S. authorities are still investigating the shooting. Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese condemned the attempted assassination as an inexcusable attack on the United States and Australia\u2019s shared democratic values. \u201cIn Australia, as in the United States, the essence and the purpose of our democracies is that we can express our views, debate our disagreements and resolve our differences peacefully,\u201d Albanese told reporters in the Australian Parliament House. Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer said on social media platform X that he was appalled by the attempt and wished Trump a quick and full recovery. \u201cPolitical violence has no place in our society! My thoughts are with all the victims of this attack!\u201d he said. Brazil\u2019s President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva said on X that the attack must be \u201cstrongly repudiated\u201d by all democracy defenders and dialogue in politics, calling the incident unacceptable. Canada\u2019s Prime Minister Justin Trudeau posted on X saying that he was sickened by the shooting and his thoughts were with Trump, those at the event and all Americans. \u201cIt cannot be overstated \u2014 political violence is never acceptable,\u201d he wrote. Chinese Foreign Ministry said in a statement that China is concerned about the attack and President Xi Jinping has already extended his regards to Trump. Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala strongly condemned the attack and wished Trump a fast recovery. Egyptian President Abdelfattah El Sissi expressed concern and stressed his country's condemnation of the attack in a statement. \u201cI express my wishes for Trump\u2019s speedy recovery and for the US election campaigns to be resumed in a peaceful and healthy atmosphere, free of any aspects of terrorism, violence, or hatred,\u201d he said. El Salvador\u2019s presidential palace said President Nayib Bukele condemned \u201cthe assassination attempt\u201d on Trump. \u201cThere is no place for violence in a democracy,\u201d the President\u2019s office said in a press release posted on X. Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas posted on X saying she was shocked by the shooting and her thoughts were with the victims. \u201cPolitical violence in any form has no justification,\u201d she wrote. French President Emmanuel Macron sent his wishes to Trump for a prompt recovery. \u201cIt is a drama for our democracies. France shares the indignation of the American people,\u201d he posted on X. Finnish President Alexander Stubb said on X that the attack shocked him and he was glad to hear that Trump seemed to be doing well. He strongly condemned the assault and any act of political violence. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz posted on X saying the attack was \u201cdespicable\u201d and such violent acts threaten democracy. \u201cMy compassionate thoughts are also with the other people who were hurt in the attack,\u201d he said. Hungary\u2019s Prime Minister Viktor Orban said his thoughts and prayers were with Trump \u201cin these dark hours\" on X. India\u2019s Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on X that he was deeply concerned by \"the attack on my friend.\u201d \u201cStrongly condemn the incident. Violence has no place in politics and democracies,\u201d he said. \u201cOur thoughts and prayers are with the family of the deceased, those injured and the American people.\u201d Israel\u2019s President Isaac Herzog said on X that he condemned \u201cutterly and unequivocally\u201d the attempt on Trump's life and wished him a fast recovery on behalf of all the Israeli people, adding their thoughts are with the victims and their families. Italy\u2019s Premier Giorgia Meloni wished Trump a quick recovery and said in a statement she hoped \"the next few months of the election campaign will see dialogue and responsibility prevail over hatred and violence.\u201d \u201cWe must stand firm against any form of violence that challenges democracy. I pray for former President Trump\u2019s speedy recovery,\u201d Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said on X. Mexico\u2019s president Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador denounced the attack on X and said \u201cviolence is irrational and inhumane.\u201d South Korea's President Yoon Suk Yeol said on X that he was appalled by \u201cthe hideous act\u201d of political violence. He added the people of Korea stand in solidarity with Americans. Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson said his country condemned \u201cthe terrible attack\" and his thoughts were with the victims and their families. \u201cSweden stands behind the United States and wish Donald Trump a speedy recovery,\u201d he said. Taiwan's president Lai Ching-te wished Trump a speedy recovery and said his thoughts and prayers are with Trump on X.

        "text": "Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin Smart city and communication network powered by IoT getty When it comes to technology, what seemed to be science fiction several decades ago can now be a mundane thing everyone takes for granted. Could we have imagined in the early 2000s that entire economic sectors would operate in near-autonomous ways under a watchful eye of monitoring sensors, cameras, and a myriad of other connected devices collectively dubbed the Internet of Things (IoT)? Once a prerogative of incorrigible enthusiasts and dreamers, this hi-tech reality is already here. In areas where human input used to be key, the onus has largely shifted towards internet-enabled devices that provide real-time data collection, remote monitoring, and automation. The number of these objects is predicted to exceed 29 billion by 2030 globally, twice the stats for 2020. Out of all the domains that IoT has revolutionized, critical infrastructure stands apart as a particularly tangible intersection of the digital and physical worlds. Today, it enhances operational efficiency, reduces costs, and steps up service reliability of electrical grids, municipal utilities, transportation systems, manufacturing entities, military facilities, airports, and more. This technological leap, predictably enough, comes with its challenges. First, deploying seamless IoT networks over long distances can require hefty engineering, construction, and investment to upgrade the existing wiring infrastructure or even build it from the ground up. Second, operating such networks is a tightrope to walk in terms of security, given the high-stakes assets at the heart of them. The Cybersecurity Achilles Heel The vast number of interconnected devices in an IoT-driven infrastructure creates a massive attack surface. These objects often have limited processing power and may miss out on robust security features, which potentially makes them easy targets. Here\u2019s a closer look at the specific concerns that shape up the unique threat model of an ecosystem like that: MORE FOR YOU Why Richard Simmons Rejected Pauly Shore\u2019s Idea For A Biopic Bitcoin Price Suddenly Soars Over $60,000 After Trump Assassination Attempt Sends His Odds Of Victory To All-Time High UFC Denver Results: Highlights, Finishes And Scorecards Unauthorized access: Many IoT devices have notoriously weak authentication protocols and are shipped with easy-to-guess default passwords that network administrators neglect to change. This leaves them vulnerable to brute-force attacks or credential stuffing. Data breaches: Without strong encryption in place, sensitive data transmitted between devices and control centers can be intercepted and mishandled. Denial of Service (DoS): IoT networks can be swamped by malformed queries whose number exceeds the server\u2019s processing capacity. This can result in significant downtime and operational issues that end up disrupting critical services. Software vulnerabilities: Outdated firmware and software on these devices can harbor unpatched security gaps, creating entry points for cyberattacks. The catch-all thing to understand is that the very nature of interconnectedness creates vulnerabilities. Perpetrators targeting a single device could gain access to a wider network, potentially causing widespread disruptions. IoT Security Done Right As cyber threats evolve, overconfidence in defenses at the network perimeter can be a losing strategy. Even with top-notch proactive security measures in place, there\u2019s always a chance of well-motivated adversaries breaking in. It\u2019s best to prevent them from weaponizing the data they might intercept, in the first place. Call it a plan B, if you will, but it eventually pays off in today\u2019s nuanced cyberspace. A good example of how this works is the logic leveraged by Actelis Networks, a global provider of cyber-hardened, quick-deployment networking solutions for utility, transportation, military, telecom, as well as federal, state, and local government IoT applications. What drew my attention is that their security philosophy combines three layers of protection: end-to-end data encryption with MACsec 256-bit cryptographic standard, data fragmentation, and scrambling. This means that to cause damage, a malicious actor would need to amass information from all nodes on the network in order to de-scramble it, put the fragments together in the correct order, and decrypt the resulting data with a unique key to make it meaningful. Anyone even remotely familiar with cryptography knows that this mission is close to impossible. With the well-thought-out security approach (dubbed the Triple Shield) and a breakthrough hybrid-fiber network deployment principle, Actelis is the only company of its kind to be included on the U.S. Department of Defense Information Network (DoDIN) approved products list (APL). This achievement, combined with NIST certification for FIPS 140-2 cryptographic standard, has predictably paved the provider\u2019s way towards new niches and projects. In early June, the company received orders to modernize three U.S. military bases with its secure networking technology. These developments came amid escalating geopolitical tensions manifesting themselves through increased cyberattacks on critical infrastructure. The trend of growing investment in military cybersecurity mirrors broader federal efforts in addressing such concerns. With its DoDIN APL and NIST credentials, as well as proprietary technology in its toolkit, Actelis is in a position to get such initiatives rolling. \"At Actelis Networks, we recognize that robust security requires more than just strong encryption. Our Triple Shield approach integrates end-to-end data encryption, data fragmentation, and scrambling to create a multi-layered defense system. This ensures that even if one layer is compromised, the data remains protected through additional layers of security,\" says Tuvia Barlev, Chairman and CEO of Actelis. \"By combining these techniques, we make it exceptionally difficult for malicious actors to access and exploit sensitive information, maintaining the integrity and confidentiality of our clients' critical infrastructure,\" he added. What\u2019s Next for IoT-Driven Critical Infrastructure? While security is crucial for networks that underlie critical infrastructure, enabling uninterrupted connectivity between IoT devices is another nontrivial challenge. This is especially true of geographically scattered environments that combine fiber, coax, and legacy copper wiring. The silver lining is that such heterogeneous cabling architectures can be glued together to deliver fiber-grade connectivity without the need to build new high-cost networks from scratch. An illustration of this tactic is Actelis\u2019 hybrid-fiber technology harnessing high-performance managed Ethernet access switches and extenders to make the most of existing network infrastructures and provide gigabit speeds via virtually any wireline media. Actelis\u2019 hybrid-fiber networking concept includes sections of fiber (for the easy-to-reach-with-fiber locations) and copper/coax that can be upgraded with Actelis\u2019 technology to run fiber-grade communication. The company does both and provides management, security, and end-to-end integration for such entire networks, including fiber parts. This is important, as it represents a significant part of the market, selling both fiber and non-fiber networking. Barlev highlights that \"The beauty of Actelis\u2019 hybrid-fiber technology lies in its ability to utilize existing network infrastructures to deliver high-speed connectivity. By integrating managed Ethernet access switches and extenders, we can achieve gigabit speeds over virtually any wireline media. This approach not only reduces deployment costs and time but also ensures that our clients can quickly and effectively modernize their networks without the need for extensive new construction.\" Connectivity is the major cost and time component in any such IoT modernization project. Actelis' ability to provide power remotely to sensors and cameras over copper/coax is a major cost and time-saving component as well. As the IoT element becomes instrumental in modernizing critical infrastructure across multiple industries, innovative network design principles come to the fore. The key challenge here is to avoid a tradeoff between deployment speed, ease of maintenance, and security. A safe world without serious technology-borne societal repercussions seems to be a matter of striking that balance for the long haul. Follow me on LinkedIn. Check out my website.

        "text": "Novak Djokovic says the prospect of creating tennis history will provide the \"fuel\" he needs to defeat Carlos Alcaraz and clinch an eighth Wimbledon title and record 25th Grand Slam on Sunday.Just five weeks after undergoing surgery on his right knee, 37-year-old Djokovic can become the oldest Wimbledon champion of the modern era and avenge his heartbreaking five-set loss to the Spaniard in last year's final.\"I'm aware of what's on the line. Any Grand Slam that I play, there's always history now on the line,\" said Djokovic.\"I will try to use that as a fuel to play my best tennis.\"On what promises to be an emotional day, the final will be played out in front of Catherine, Princess of Wales, who will be making just her second public appearance following her cancer diagnosis earlier this year.UK media reported that she will also present the trophy to the champion.Djokovic will be playing in his 10th Wimbledon final and 37th at the 75 majors in which he has played.A 25th Grand Slam title would be an all-time record for men and women, snapping the mark of 24 he shares with Margaret Court.\"It serves as a great motivation, but at the same time it's also a lot of pressure and expectations,\" added the Serb.\"Every time I step out on the court now, even though I'm 37 and competing with the 21-year-olds, I still expect myself to win most of the matches, and people expect me to win 99 percent of the matches that I play.\"Djokovic arrived at Wimbledon under a form and fitness cloud.The 22-year-old Italian Jannik Sinner took his Australian Open title and then his world number one ranking and Alcaraz succeeded him as French Open champion.Djokovic had not reached a final this season before arriving at the All England Club and he has yet to beat a top-10 player.When he played his first-round match against qualifier Vit Kopriva it was only 27 days after he had gone under the knife to repair a torn meniscus, which had forced him to withdraw before his quarter-final at Roland Garros.On the eve of Wimbledon, Djokovic still was not certain he would be able to compete.\"We agreed that we would not talk about my guaranteed Wimbledon participation until three, four days before the tournament starts,\" explained Djokovic.\"I understand why people were thinking it's premature, it's maybe reckless, but I don't think it was, to be honest.\"Alcaraz, 16 years Djokovic's junior, is in his fourth Grand Slam final and is looking to add a second Wimbledon to his 2022 US Open breakthrough and French Open title from last month. His win in the 2023 All England Club final snapped Djokovic's 34-match winning streak at the tournament.Alcaraz has endured an uneven tournament.On Friday, he defeated Daniil Medvedev in the semi-finals but only after having to come back from dropping the first set for the third time at the tournament.He is bidding to become only the sixth man to win the French Open and Wimbledon back-to-back.However, Djokovic has won their past two meetings -- in the 2023 Cincinnati Open final and then in the semi-finals of the season-ending ATP Tour Finals.Alcaraz hopes to make it a super Sunday for Spain by winning the Wimbledon final before the country's national football team face England in the Euro 2024 final in Berlin.\"Being a Spaniard, yeah, it would be a perfect Sunday,\" said Alcaraz.\"It's going to be a really fun day for Spanish people watching my final, watching the Euros final.\"Alcaraz has been warned to expect a super-charged Djokovic, who has swept into the final with two straight-sets wins punctuated by an injury walkover handed to him by Alex de Minaur in the last eight.Alcaraz said that he does not see himself as favourite despite the age gap and potential issues with the Serb's knee.\"If he's in the final it's because he's at a high level,\" said the Spaniard.\"I don't see myself as a favourite. The winner will be the one who plays the best in the match and who deals better in the situations that arise.\"",

        "text": "Shortly after shots rang out at his Pennsylvania rally, former President Donald Trump\u2019s supporters adorned their social media profiles with pictures of the bloodied presumptive Republican presidential nominee defiantly pumping his fist in the air with an American flag in the background. This iconic image will appear on the front page of newspapers across the globe and is the latest dramatic event making Trump\u2019s committed supporters more determined than ever to send him back to the White House. Trump was already set to descend on the Republican National Convention as the party\u2019s presidential standard-bearer for the third straight election. Now he will be received as a conquering hero, the survivor of an assassination attempt captured on camera. It is the latest twist in a presidential race that has already seen its share of unprecedented turns, from Trump\u2019s felony convictions in the New York hush money case following four indictments in multiple jurisdictions to the post-debate mutiny inside the Democratic Party against President Joe Biden. The gunfire at Trump\u2019s Pennsylvania rally will also touch off another wave of discussion about political violence in the United States, including the shooting of then-House Majority Leader Steve Scalise (R-LA) during a practice session for the Congressional Baseball Game in 2017, the attack on New York GOP gubernatorial candidate Lee Zeldin by a knife-wielding man in 2022, and the riot at the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. A rallygoer was killed at the Trump event on Saturday night. \u201cUS Secret Service neutralized the shooter, who is now deceased,\u201d was how the agency charged with protecting Trump and Biden summarized the suspect\u2019s fate. But to have a bullet whiz past the head of a former and perhaps future president, grazing his ear, on the eve of the national nominating convention that will kick off the general election in earnest is a momentous event in the turbulent campaign. Biden issued a statement condemning the shooting. \u201cI\u2019m grateful to hear that he\u2019s safe and doing well,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m praying for him and his family and for all those who were at the rally, as we await further information.\u201d The president then decamped to a police station in Rehoboth, Delaware, where he was spending the weekend, to deliver live remarks. \u201cThere\u2019s no place in America for this kind of violence,\u201d Biden said. \u201cIt\u2019s sick. It\u2019s sick. It\u2019s one of the reasons why we need to unite this country. \u2026 We cannot be like this. We cannot condone this.\u201d He left Delaware to return to the White House hours later. The Biden campaign is pausing its ads \u201cas quickly as possible\u201d after the shooting. Trump had the presence of mind to stand and face the crowd in the aftermath of the shooting, pumping his fist in the air and mouthing the word \u201cFight\u201d several times. The audio captured him telling the Secret Service agents trying to evacuate him from the scene to wait as he projected this image to the world. When then-President Ronald Reagan was shot by John Hinckley Jr. in 1981, he insisted on walking into the hospital on his own power. He collapsed when he got inside. Theodore Roosevelt completed a speech after he endured a failed assassination attempt, then himself a former president campaigning to return to office. \u201cI don\u2019t know whether you fully understand that I have just been shot \u2014 but it takes more than that to kill a Bull Moose,\u201d Roosevelt told the crowd. Trump was not nearly as seriously injured, though a photographer captured how close a bullet came to his head. He nevertheless demonstrated sharp gut-level political and stagecraft instincts under fire, in what supporters and some foes will surely see as a display of physical courage. It comes at a time when Biden\u2019s own vigor and decisiveness is being questioned. \u201cWe all know President Trump is stronger than his enemies,\u201d Gov. Doug Burgum (R-ND) wrote on X. \u201cToday he showed it.\u201d He later reposted this with the memorable photograph of Trump. Burgum wasn\u2019t the only Republican on Trump\u2019s vice presidential short list to weigh in. Sen. J.D. Vance (R-OH) excoriated a Democratic lawmaker who proposed removing Trump\u2019s Secret Service protection if sentenced to prison. \u201cKick his ass out of Congress,\u201d Vance posted on X. \u201cAbsolute scumbag.\u201d Vance also echoed what will be a common refrain in the coming days, raising the question of whether framing Trump as a uniquely malevolent threat to democracy is itself an incitement to violence. Trump supporters believe his opponents will stop at nothing to prevent his return to power. \u201c\u200b\u200bThe central premise of the Biden campaign is that President Donald Trump is an authoritarian fascist who must be stopped at all costs,\u201d Vance wrote. \u201cThat rhetoric led directly to President Trump\u2019s attempted assassination.\u201d Democrats and prominent media figures sharply criticized Republican political rhetoric after the 2011 shooting of then-Rep. Gabby Giffords. Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) said on social media that God protected Trump. Sen. Tim Scott (R-SC) urged prayers for the former president. Trump and his campaign thanked the Secret Service and first responders. \u201cPresident Trump looks forward to joining you all in Milwaukee as we proceed with our convention to nominate him to serve as the 47th President of the United States,\u201d read a joint statement from the campaign and the Republican National Committee. That convention will be more electric and ecstatic to receive him in the wake of Saturday\u2019s shocking and horrifying events.",

And so I come full circle in this response and just want to encourage you with some substance that we are in the process of the second American revolution, which will remain bloodless if the left allows it to be,\u201d Roberts said Tuesday on Real America\u2019s Voice. Project 2025 is a set of proposals designed to dramatically reshape the federal government and consolidate executive power if Trump is elected in November. The New Abnormal\u2019s co-host Danielle Moodie said \u201cpeople need to pay attention\u201d to what the far right has in store if Donald Trump returns to the White House. \u201cI cannot tell you how many of these Republican fascists have talked about bloodshed from Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration on. From folks talking about \u2018there are more guns on our side\u2019. They want war. They want bloodshed. They want America to be this Christian fundamentalist Gilead shell of itself where women stay home, Black people move off sidewalks to let massa walk through, and LGBTQ+ people don\u2019t exist and if they do, they\u2019re criminalized and thrown in jail. This is what these people want and I don\u2019t know why shit like this isn\u2019t trending and being discussed for two fucking weeks. Instead we talk about Biden\u2019s age when what is more dangerous is what these people are saying out loud because they\u2019re no longer afraid of repercussions.\u201d Subscribe to The New Abnormal on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Google Podcasts, Stitcher, Amazon Music, or Overcast. \u201cReally his tone there\u2014it\u2019s so striking how confident he is that this is OK to say out loud. I would not blame one of my apolitical friends for thinking that I was playing them a clip from The Purge if I showed that to them because that\u2019s what it sounds like,\u201d said The New Abnormal\u2019s producer Jesse Cannon. \u201cWhen you listen to these people and how they are justifying the policies that they want created through the lens of their God, there\u2019s no length that they\u2019re not willing to go to in order to make that happen and seem justified in the process because of their religious convictions. That to me is what is scary,\u201d said Moodie. \u201cWe\u2019ve been saying for a while there\u2019s no quiet part anymore. That really just sums it up,\u201d said The New Abnormal\u2019s co-host Andy Levy. Plus!

This week the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) group withdrew its conditional endorsement of Ocasio-Cortez, claiming she is not supportive enough of the Palestinian position in efforts to end the war in Gaza. This was a significant break. In 2018\u2014when Ocasio-Cortez stunned US politics by unseating a veteran, and senior, Democrat in a primary race for a House seat in NY\u2014it was grassroots organizations like the DSA, alongside the Justice Democrats, who played a key role in helping organize, canvass and mobilize support. It\u2019s worth remembering how sensational and unexpected her victory was, as is reflected in reporting of her victory in June 2018 in the New York Times: \u201cMr. Crowley was defeated by a 28-year-old political newcomer, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a former organizer for Bernie Sanders\u2019s presidential campaign, who had declared it was time for generational, racial and ideological change.\u201d She had come out of nowhere. And yet, 24 hours later, the same news organization declared that \u201cAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez Emerges as a Political Star.\u201d As Harold Wilson, the former British prime minister famously said, \u201cA week is a long time in politics.\u201d The DSA\u2019s statement is merely the latest criticism from the left that claims that Ocasio-Cortez has compromised her radical politics in exchange for a seat at the top table. One uncharacteristic misstep on her road from political outsider to insider was her appearance at the Met Gala in 2021 when she arrived in a Tax the Rich gown. This provoked a storm of criticism from the left and right. Donald Trump Jr. hit out at her hypocrisy in sending a message about taxing the rich \u201cwhile she\u2019s hanging out with a bunch of wealthy leftwing elites.\u201d On the left there was an equally furious response. Briahna Gray, the former national press secretary for Senator Bernie Sanders\u2019 2020 campaign, said the response was, in part, born from disappointment with her perceived lack of progress on progressive issues, \u201cPeople are disappointed in her behavior outside of this context, and this seems to be reflective of a lack of commitment that has been demonstrated in a purely political context.\u201d This was politics as theater\u2014but the critics weren\u2019t amused. And, increasingly, Ocasio-Cortez has made a very deliberate shift from firebrand tactics and social media provocations to working the levers of power on Capitol Hill. She secured a senior position on a powerful House committee and learned to work with allies on the left and right (among them the ultra-MAGA Floridian Rep. Matt Gaetz, in crafting a bill that would ban lawmakers from owning stocks). This is a world away from the day, in her first week in the House in 2018, when she was among a group of protesters who occupied then-minority leader Nancy Pelosi\u2019s office to demand more action on climate change. Ocasio-Cortez has acknowledged the change and explained how and why it had to happen. Stung by the hostility she faced from Congressional Democrats, who seemed to take umbrage at this young, demonstrative woman of color, she gradually re-thought how she could make headway, not just headlines. She had a fractious (at best) relationship with Nancy Pelosi, who seemed singularly unimpressed by her and her fellow Squad members. In an interview with the New York Times in 2019, Pelosi said, \u201cAll these people have their public whatever and their Twitter world. But they don\u2019t have any following. They\u2019re four people, and that\u2019s how many votes they got.\u201d In another biting putdown, a senior aide to Pelosi, when asked what the veteran leader really thought of Ocasio-Cortez revealed, \u201cNancy doesn\u2019t have much patience for people who don\u2019t know what they don\u2019t know.\u201d To negotiate the byzantine\u2014and often embittered\u2014world of Capitol politics, Ocasio-Cortez 2.0 started to emerge. In a Q&A last year headlined Alexandra Ocasioo-Cortez on How She Has Changed, she was forthright about this awakening \u201cI had to prove to this world of Washington that I was serious and skilled, and that I wasn\u2019t just here to make a headline, but that I was here to engage in this process in a skilled and sophisticated way. That I did my homework, so to speak.\u201d In doing the homework, some marked it down. A year ago New York Magazine ran a long, scathing piece headlined \u201cAOC Is Just a Regular Old Democrat Now\u201d, in which the writer criticized her for \u201cconsistent fealty to Democratic Party leadership,\u201d and as someone who is \u201cincreasingly comfortable with leaving her past radical branding behind.\u201d Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s journey involves a difficult balance. As the writers of a lengthy profile in Politico charting her journey over the last six years, pointed out, \u201cOcasio-Cortez\u2019s new profile also isn\u2019t without risk. The Democratic base doesn\u2019t typically reward an ability to work the inside levers of Congress. But the influence she can accrue by playing Congress\u2019 inside track may prove to be as potent as the saturation-level media exposure she would forgo in the process.\u201d Ocasio-Cortez is aware of that balance, and the journey she is on. As she said last year, \u201cI think that perhaps some of the things that would describe me in this moment might be: evolving, learning, challenging myself.\u201d And in challenging herself, she is also, increasingly, being challenged.",

        "text": "Delegates and top party officials from across the country are set to convene for the quadrennial Republican National Convention in Milwaukee on Monday, hours after an apparent attempt to assassinate former President Donald Trump at his rally in Pennsylvania on Saturday. Trump, whose campaign declared the convention will go on after a bullet appeared to graze his ear at the rally, will be nominated at the event. But the convention will also be where delegates vote to establish an official party platform. The shooting, which killed one rallygoer and critically injured two others, has further galvanized Republican support for Trump, with even his staunchest GOP critics denouncing the violence. This year, however, will also feature a number of changes for the Republican gathering that demonstrate the former president\u2019s sway over the party as he mounts a return to the White House. One of the most prominent changes is the updated party platform, which has been reduced from its 66-page document in 2016 to just 16 pages in 2024. That change, officials say, was done to make the party\u2019s principles more digestible to voters and help streamline campaign messaging. \u201cThe most substantial difference that people will notice is this is a small document,\u201d Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), who served as the chairwoman of the RNC platform committee, told the Washington Examiner. \u201cIt has 10 short chapters. They\u2019re not even a page in length, and each of the 10 chapters deals with a separate policy issue and deals with things that the American people are wanting us to do.\u201d Possibly the greatest policy change included in the updated document is Republicans\u2019 stance on abortion. The new language states that the GOP opposes late-term abortion but stops short of calling for any constitutional amendments or a national ban on the procedure. Additionally, the platform would establish support for \u201cmothers and policies that advance prenatal care, access to birth control, and IVF (fertility treatments),\u201d according to the text. The language is a shift from its 2016 platform that asserted \u201cthe unborn child has a fundamental right to life which cannot be infringed.\u201d The 2016 language also called for a \u201chuman life amendment to the Constitution,\u201d which is not included in the 2024 document. The new language has been praised by some anti-abortion groups for establishing a \u201cpro-life position\u201d that still allows Republicans to thwart Democrats, who typically dominate messaging on the issue and at the ballot box. \u201cWe are a pro-life party. We\u2019re going to be a pro-life party. We\u2019re going to be a pro-family party,\u201d Blackburn said. \u201cThe language needed to be changed because the goal of setting aside [Roe v. Wade] was achieved, and it recognizes that that goal was achieved after 50 years.\u201d The new platform was hammered out behind closed doors \u2014 another shift from years prior. The process was also not broadcast on C-SPAN as it has in the past, breaking from years of precedent. Some delegates supported the move, arguing it allowed the party to make decisions without lobbyist interference and in a way that would help boost Trump\u2019s candidacy. \u201c[The committee] reworked the Republican Party platform instead of all the lobbyists and all these people trying to get their own two cents worth into the platform,\u201d Mike McMullen, a delegate from the state of Pennsylvania, told the Washington Examiner. \u201cPresident Trump has taken over the Republican Party, has gotten his people in, has cleaned up the language, [and] made it very simple.\u201d However, not all delegates were happy with the closed-off communication, telling the Washington Examiner they will be looking to ensure party leaders don\u2019t form a habit of making decisions in private. \u201cI\u2019m just worried. I want to see what happens behind the scenes and how this stuff happened,\u201d one delegate said. \u201cI want our party to do things out in the open, transparent. That first platform meeting wasn\u2019t that, so I want to be that. I want us to live up to our ideals of being transparent and open and honest.\u201d The convention is scheduled to begin on Monday and last through Thursday with different themes for each day focusing on the economy, public safety, border security, and international policy.",

        "text": "CLEVELAND, Ohio \u2014 The Browns offensive line is usually one of the better and more consistent units in the NFL, though the 2023 season wasn\u2019t the best for this unit. Their performance took a step back mostly due to multiple injuries suffered, especially at tackle. Jack Conklin was the first to go down for the season in Week 1, with Jedrick Wills Jr. and Dawand Jones going down halfway through the season. For the sake of staying prepared ahead of the season, and possible injuries, is it best to use Conklin as a swing tackle? It\u2019s not the worst idea as Conklin has played on both sides of the line. During his college days at Michigan State, he started 35 games as a left tackle, and started three on the right side. He made a total switch since entering the NFL and has played most of his snaps as a right tackle for Tennessee and Cleveland. But he played 68 snaps at left tackle for Tennessee in his first couple pro seasons, per Pro Football Focus. The irony is each of these offensive tackles mentioned have experience playing on both sides, but the more experienced Conklin could be the better choice. Check out the video at the top of this post to watch Sports 4 CLE host Dave Bacon and The Browns Wire\u2019s Jacob Roach discuss Jack Conklin and the Browns offensive line for the 2024 season.",

        "text": "Global leaders have expressed concern Sunday over an assassination attempt targeting former U.S. President Donald Trump at a rally in Pennsylvania that left one attendee dead and critically injured two others, with many condemning the violence that shocked the world.

[+] Area, Danville, California, March 10, 2024. (Photo by Smith Collection/Gado/Getty Images) Gado via Getty Images The Cybertruck is now officially a price segment leader. And that\u2019s driving a pricey used CT market. Kelley Blue Book, in a new report, says new EV prices \u201chave been trending higher since the spring...In large part...driven by market leader Tesla, which has seen prices increase 13% since January.\u201d But it\u2019s not just the Model Y and Model 3 driving the price upticks, it\u2019s the Cybertruck. \u201cThe new Cybertruck is likely one reason Tesla [Average Transaction Prices] have increased,\u201d Kelley Blue Book said. Cybertruck best-selling vehicle in ultra high end segment: In June, the Cybertruck was the best-selling vehicle priced over $100,000, said KBB. The average transaction price was $112,696 with more than 3,200 units sold, KBB said. That puts the Cybertruck in rarified high-end segment company, including the likes of the Mercedes-Benz S-Class, the BMW 7 Series, and Bentley. Used Cybertruck market still growing: Kelley Blue Book shows 256 results for used Cybertrucks in the U.S. as of mid-July, a marked rise from May when used CT listings were around 100. But don\u2019t think you\u2019re necessarily going to get a great deal. A quick glance at the pricing for used Cybertrucks shows the average asking price is above the ATP for new Cybertrucks. While used Tesla Model 3 and Model Y prices have been declining, used Cybertruck prices have stayed high, according to Cars.com, which showed an average list price of above $140,000 for the Cybertruck in a report released last month. Cybertruck is not a great deal as a used car.

        "text": "A Hamas official on Sunday said the group is pulling out of Gaza truce talks, following an Israeli strike that targeted the militants' commander Mohammed Deif, who was \"fine\" despite the attack according to another Hamas figure. \"Commander Mohammed Deif is well and directly overseeing\" the operations of the Hamas military wing, the official told AFP. Israel staged a huge bombing raid on a camp for displaced people in southern Gaza on Saturday that it said was an attempt to kill Deif. Another senior official from the Iran-backed Islamist group, which has been fighting a nine-month-long war with Israel in the Gaza Strip, said Hamas was withdrawing from ceasefire talks because of Israeli \"massacres\" and the country's attitude in negotiations. The health ministry in the Hamas-run Gaza Strip said at least 92 people had been killed, more than half of them women and children, and 300 wounded in a strike on the Al-Mawasi camp. Ismail Haniyeh, Hamas's Qatar-based political chief, told international mediators of the \"decision to halt negotiations due to the occupation's (Israel) lack of seriousness, continued policy of procrastination and obstruction, and the ongoing massacres against unarmed civilians\", the official said. Talks mediated by Qatar and Egypt, with US support, have for months tried but failed to bring a halt to the war in the Gaza Strip. - 'No certainty' - Al-Mawasi, where the health ministry said dozens had been killed, had in May been declared a safe humanitarian zone by the Israeli military and civilians ordered to evacuate to it. However, there have been multiple deadly incidents there blamed on Israeli strikes. Philippe Lazzarini, head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, described the area as \"a sandy 14-square-kilometre (5.4-square-mile) agricultural land, where people are left out in the open with little to no buildings or roads\". \"The claim that people in Gaza can move to 'safe' or 'humanitarian' zones is false\", said Lazzarini on social media site X. Israel said it had targeted Deif, the head of the Al-Qassam Brigades, as well as Rafa Salama, a brigade commander, in a strike on Saturday. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said late Saturday there was \"no certainty\" either man had been killed in the strike. Deif has been among Israel's most wanted men for decades and is blamed by Israeli authorities for the killings of multiple civilians and soldiers. There have been at least six previous attempts on his life. He announced in an audio message the start of Hamas's surprise October 7 attack on southern Israel, which sparked the Gaza war, and the military has labelled him and Salama \"two of the masterminds\" of the attack. Separately on Sunday, rescuers said at least eight people were killed in three separate strikes on different parts of Gaza City. The Israeli military meanwhile said operations were continuing throughout the territory, including in Gaza City and Rafah. Hamas's October 7 attack resulted in the deaths of 1,195 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures. The militants also seized 251 hostages, 116 of whom remain in Gaza, including 42 the military says are dead. Israel responded with a military offensive that has killed at least 38,443 people in Gaza, also mostly civilians, according to a toll from the Gaza health ministry issued Saturday afternoon. - 'Horrific massacre' - The deaths in the camp in Al-Mawasi drew condemnation from governments across the region, with Egypt's foreign ministry saying such \"crimes... cannot be accepted under any justification whatsoever\". The Israeli military said of its attack targeting Deif that \"the area that was struck is an open area, surrounded by trees, several buildings and sheds. It was not a tent complex, but an operational compound\". A Hamas statement rejected Israel's claim it had targeted Deif, saying it was intended \"to cover up the magnitude of the horrific massacre\". Earlier this week, US President Joe Biden had said that a framework for a truce and hostage deal he had set out earlier in the war was \"now agreed on by both Israel and Hamas\". \"There are still gaps to close, but we're making progress,\" he added. On Saturday night Hamas official Bassem Naim told AFP that Netanyahu was to blame for the impasse and called on Biden to put \"sufficient pressure\" on the Israeli leader to secure a deal. The negotiations have been brought to a halt by Hamas's withdrawal Sunday, but the official quoted Haniyeh as saying that the group was \"ready to resume negotiations when the occupation government (Israel) demonstrates seriousness in reaching a ceasefire agreement and a prisoner exchange deal\". An Israeli security source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said on Saturday that the strike showed Israel \"will continue to target senior Hamas leadership\" even as it \"pursues negotiations for a hostage agreement\". bur-dcp/jsa",

        "text": "Voters in Midwestern states are seeing ads railing against President Biden\u2019s gas car ban. But there\u2019s one catch: the Biden administration hasn\u2019t prohibited gas-powered vehicles. That\u2019s not stopping fossil fuel industry groups and former President Donald Trump from targeting swing state voters with warnings of car bans. The American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers, a trade group with major fossil fuel members, announced multimillion ad buys this year spotlighting state and federal policies for new car production. The ads urge viewers in the key presidential and Senate swing states of Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Arizona, Georgia, Montana, Ohio and Texas to oppose Biden-era rules that improve fuel economy. AFPM\u2019s ads claim, without evidence, that the rules ban gas vehicles. \u201cWe're not coming in in support of a candidate or an opposition of a candidate,\u201d said Chet Thompson, AFPM President. \u201cThis is about informing people that this is happening and where they can go to get more information and to weigh in.\u201d Some states have adopted even more ambitious fuel economy goals than the Biden administration. But the AFPM ad buys are not taking place in those states. Instead, the AFPM ads aim to sway voters in states key to winning the White House and Congress in this year\u2019s election. Thompson said his group\u2019s goal is to get lobbyists and policymakers to pay attention. \u201cWe're in an election year, so we ought to go to places where the campaigns are paying attention. And, of course, that's in the swing states,\u201d Thompson said. AFPM, whose membership includes ExxonMobil, Chevron and Phillips 66, said the ads don\u2019t advocate for any particular candidate. (ExxonMobil and Chevron are both NPR funders). But political advertisement experts say the ad campaign echoes the broader conservative plan to mobilize people who are like-minded in their mistrust of electric vehicles, whether they\u2019re base voters or those who\u2019ve never voted. \u201cAnger is a mobilizing emotion,\u201d said Dustin Carnahan, associate professor in the department of communication at Michigan State University, who researches political communication. \u201cAnd by spreading these false claims, it's trying to get voters \u2014 probably who are already predisposed to oppose Biden or the Democratic Party\u2014 to mobilize and show their power at the polls.\u201d Multimillion-dollar ad-buys highlight a so-called \u201ccar ban\u201d A recent fuel manufacturers ad shows a woman driving through a suburban neighborhood. A narrator warns that \u201cPresident Biden is banning most new gas cars\u201d and that he has put the \u201cfreedom to choose what to drive in the rearview mirror.\u201d As the woman drives, she notices that Biden is gleefully sitting in her back seat. \u201cWe can\u2019t leave our choices, our economic strength and our national security in the rearview mirror,\u201d the narrator says, urging audiences to call on Senators to overturn the \u201cBiden car ban.\u201d The ad is a part of AFPM\u2019s eight-figure campaign, with this latest commercial released in June. Within their first two weeks, eight iterations of the ad targeting Biden and various Democratic Senators and Representatives in presidential and congressional swing states ran more than 1,400 times and were viewed over 27 million times, according to an NPR analysis of data from AdImpact, a firm that collects real-time ad data and analytics. The AFPM campaign started earlier in the year. A second wave of ads came in February and a third in May. All the ads mention a ban on gas cars and emphasize the narrative that the new regulations limit consumer choice and freedom. \u201cThey have that immediate, visceral reaction,\u201d Carnahan said. \u201cAnd so that's really the strategy. It's just to mobilize, it's to anger, it's to confuse. And it's also to make the other side have to respond and make them play defense.\u201d Gas cars are not illegal, but making new ones is not a priority When running for president in 2020, Biden pledged to create a 100%clean energy economy, in large part by incentivizing faster adoption of renewable energy and requiring better fuel economy from cars and trucks. Transportation, powered overwhelmingly by fossil fuels, is one of the top sources of greenhouse gas pollution driving climate change, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. To rein in climate pollution,the Biden EPA adopted ambitious standards earlier this year to decrease emissions from passenger vehicles. For car makers to meet those goals, they will have to make fewer gas-powered cars and more electric vehicles. However, the EPA rules do not ban the sale or ownership of gas cars, and car makers have until 2032 to transition to more EVs and fewer conventional vehicles. There are some electric vehicle mandates but they\u2019re separate from the Biden administration. Two years ago, regulators in California voted to phase out the sale of new gasoline-powered vehicles, creating a total ban on sales for the state by 2035. The restrictions would apply to new cars only. People could still drive gas-powered vehicles, and buy and sell used gas cars. Plug-in hybrids, which can run on gasoline or electricity, would also be allowed. California is the only state allowed to create its vehicle emission standards, and they typically exceed the national standards. Other states either follow federal rules, or their legislatures can vote to adopt the more stringent California standards. So far, 12 other state legislatures have approved opting into the California standard. But none of those states are targeted by these ads. \u201cBecause of the size of California and the size of those combined markets, it will impact automakers' decisions on what to offer in the United States,\u201d said Stephanie Brinley, an associate director with S&P Global Mobility. \u201cIt doesn't mean gas cars go away. It does mean we're going to see more electrification.\u201d In swing states targeted by the AFPM ads, voters are not likely to see significant changes in the availability of gas cars in the near future, because none of them have adopted the more stringent California standards. Experts like Brinley say the transition to EVs will likely be gradual. \u201cGoing to 100% electric vehicles in the next decade is extremely unlikely. No matter what the regulations say,\u201d she said. AFPM\u2019s Thompson said his group does not oppose electric vehicles, generally. But they do oppose the prioritization of non-gas powered vehicles and have also joined efforts to legally challenge the fuel economy rules. \u201cWe're not weighing in and saying, \u2018Vote against Biden in the upcoming election,\u2019\u201d Thompson said. \u201cWe put Biden in there because it's his policies. He's the only person right now that could stop this.\u201d The ads underscore the role of energy in the 2024 election AFPM overwhelmingly donates to Republican candidates, though they also ran ads in opposition to a Trump-era fuels policy. But this election cycle, groups that are against expanded electric vehicle production and Biden's clean energy initiatives have targeted Democratic candidates in states with electoral significance\u2013often with false claims about those climate policies. Trump, the presumptive GOP nominee, has also taken to railing against an \u201celectric vehicle mandate\" in these states\u2014 even includingit in his GOP 2024 party platform. No such mandate exists. Still, when he speaks to crowds on the campaign trail, Trump pushes a similar message to what\u2019s on the airwaves: Biden wants to ban your car. \u201cThe day after the election it all stops because he wants everybody to have electric cars, which the whole thing is ridiculous,\u201d Trump said in Green Bay, Wisc. \u201cNothing is as crazy as allowing millions of people to come into our country but the electric car is crazy.\u201d \u201cMichigan, you\u2019re going to be screwed,\u201d he said in Waterford Township, MI. In Philadelphia, PA, Trump warned that if Democrats win, \u201cyou will never see oil again,\u201d or a car that \u201cdoesn\u2019t go more than a very short distance.\u201d He isn\u2019t the only one using electric vehicles and energy to campaign against Democrats. In Wisconsin, an ad by the GOP funder Restoration PAC falsely claimed that Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wisc., cut Medicare funding to redirect money to subsidize electric vehicles. The ad was eventually pulled off the air. Other groups, like the American Petroleum Institute, are also running ads in swing states that accuse Biden of having a gas car ban. API spokesperson Bethany Williams said that their campaign is addressing a \u201cde facto ban,\u201d and despite running the ad in Pennsylvania and Michigan, they said they are not taking a stance on parties or the presidential election since they are a bipartisan organization. \u201cDuring an election year where inflation is top of mind, API is working to inform the debate and educate voters, candidates and policymakers on both sides of the aisle of the importance of sound energy policies,\u201d Williams said in a statement. \u201cOur message is clear: We need fewer mandates and more bipartisan solutions that protect consumer choice and secure American energy leadership.\u201d An analysis from the campaign finance tracking nonprofit OpenSecrets found that Republicans are the biggest recipients of campaign contributions from the oil and gas industry \u2014 with GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump at the top. The Biden campaign, which ranks 18th on the list of contributions from the oil and gas sector, did not comment on the record about the ads. And it has not done its own paid media to address the ads or their claims. Climate Power, a progressive climate and energy group created by Biden\u2019s now-senior adviser for international climate policy John Podesta, said they have launched their own campaigns to counter these and other ads. They argue the Biden fuel economy rules increase consumer choices by making electric vehicle options more widely available. \u201cClean energy jobs and the ability to choose the vehicle you want to drive and the ability to power your home in the way you want to do it is going to be absolutely an important part of this campaign and this election,\u201d said Alex Witt, senior advisor for oil and gas at Climate Power. Still, they said they are not concerned about the ads\u2019 impact on voters. \u201cThose are the same states where we've seen a clean energy boom and those ads are not being shown in a vacuum,\u201d Witt said. \u201cThe people who see them are experiencing what the clean energy economy can do for their communities, too.\u201d The United Auto Workers union is also trying to defuse the message the ads are spreading. Its sizable membership is prized by candidates, particularly in Midwestern swing states. David Green, UAW regional director representing Ohio and Indiana, said ads like the ones run by AFPM are \u201cfear-mongering\u201d that taps into concerns workers have about their jobs. \u201cOur members were concerned because we all know that electric cars need less parts,\u201d Green said. \u201cAnd automation is something I've seen take jobs away my entire career.\u201d But the UAW is looking to make sure that workers who currently make internal combustion engines, which are powered by gas, are able to find safe, high-paying jobs manufacturing parts for electric vehicles, such as lithium-ion battery manufacturing. \u201cJust because we're moving towards green jobs, that doesn't mean they have to come at the cost of union jobs,\u201d Green said. \u201cAnd that's when you hear the UAW talk about a just transition. We've not only talked about it, we've done it.\u201d On Thursday, the Biden administration announced over $1 billion in grants to help auto plants transition from manufacturing parts for gas-only vehicles to parts for electric cars. But Brinley said the rules boosting EV production are now beyond politics. Automakers are adapting to global markets and international and domestic demand increasingly shifting away from the production of gas-only vehicles. \u201cIt's not the Democrats who can say this is what you get and that's all you can buy. Or the Republican stance can save you from having to make that choice,\u201d Brinley said. \u201cIt's far beyond the political parties.\u201d",

        "text": "One Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree player has recently managed to beat the DLC without collecting a single map fragment. Their unusual feat later made the rounds on social media after being shared by their friend, who was left flabbergasted by their Shadow of the Erdtree playing habits. As was the case with the base game, its expansion includes multiple map fragments that allow players to chart out its map in increments. Most of these fragments aren't exactly hidden by Elden Ring's standards, and are instead among the first things that players will come across when they reach a new region in Shadow of the Erdtree's Land of Shadow. Elden Ring Player Blitzes Through DLC Without Collecting a Single Map Fragment Many fans would hence consider ignoring map fragments to be more difficult than collecting them. But that is precisely what one player recently did, having managed to rampage through most of the major DLC regions without revealing a single portion of the giant Shadow of the Erdtree map. Their friend, Reddit user Tokennn, was later left befuddled by the state of their map after asking about their DLC progress. Elaborating on this bizarre playing style, Tokennn explained that their friend doesn't have a lot of time for gaming and was only able to play Shadow of the Erdtree roughly one hour per day. Given those limitations, they had decided to simply rush through its story as fast as humanly possible. They hence weren't exactly actively ignoring map fragments; they just weren't paying attention to them. Tokennn recalled how their friend employed a similar strategy in the base game, blitzing through Elden Ring without seeing some of its most memorable secret bosses, such as Malenia. This time around, the time-constrained player managed to reach Enir-Ilim, the final DLC location, without seeing the Hinterlands or exploring the depths of the Stone Coffin Fissure, both of which offer some interesting insights into Elden Ring lore. Like many other fans, the player had then hit a wall in the form of the final Shadow of the Erdtree boss. Following over 30 unsuccessful attempts, they had decided to look up the easiest way to deal with the excruciating fight, which is how they ended up triumphing with a combination of the Fingerprint Stone Shield and a spear, Tokennn explained. Generally speaking, spear-poking the final boss to death may not be the most engaging way to deal with that Shadow of the Erdtree fight. Nevertheless, many Elden Ring fans were impressed by this overall story, not least because rushing through one of the most difficult DLCs FromSoftware ever made is far from an easy feat.",

Meanwhile, Trump is threatening to pull out U.S. troops if elected in November and Putin is providing expertise and technology for North Korean missiles capable of dropping warheads on the South. A former judge who is married to a judge, Na is marshaling a campaign that polls indicate has rising support among South Koreans, to whom Trump represents almost as much of a security threat as Putin. Sure, the alliance between the U.S. and South Korea, \u201cis functioning as a deterrent,\u201d she said while announcing her candidacy for party leadership, \u201cbut it cannot guarantee changes in the future security environment.\u201d She wants the U.S., which has blocked South Korea from developing nukes for anything other than energy, to jettison that policy. That\u2019s a polite way of expressing widespread misgivings about Trump, who during his first term demanded that South Korea pay $5 billion a year to cover the cost of American troops defending South Korea. That demand jeopardized the future of America\u2019s largest U.S. base overseas, Camp Humphreys, 40 miles south of Seoul, and nearby Osan Air Base. The Biden administration got the South to agree to pay $1 billion, as originally proposed. It was on June 25, the 74th anniversary of the North Korean invasion of the South, that Na \u201ckicked a hornets\u2019 nest that shows no signs of dying down\u201d by declaring that South Korea should become a nuclear power. NK News, a Seoul-based website that tracks both Koreas, reported her as saying, \u201cNow we have to arm ourselves with nuclear weapons too.\u201d Conservatives \u201crallied behind Na\u2019s position,\u201d NK News said, \u201creigniting a debate about nuclear weapons that had largely faded into the background since the allies sought to nip the issue in the bud last year.\u201d The party, though, is fractured for other reasons. Na has fallen out with President Yoon for joining in criticism of Yoon\u2019s wife for accepting a $2,200 Dior handbag as a gift\u2014and for supporting a scheme that did not have his approval, for rewarding couples for having babies. Since South Korea\u2019s constitution bans a president from serving more than one five-year term, however, she will not have to run against him for their party\u2019s nomination for president in 2027. At 60, Na has earned her conservative credentials battling through the maelstrom of Korean politics, failing twice to become mayor of Seoul but being elected five times to the National Assembly, most recently in April when the opposition Democratic Party gained considerably more assembly seats than her People Power Party. The first woman to head the assembly\u2019s foreign affairs committee, Na is all for the war games with the Americans that President Yoon has enthusiastically endorsed, and for improving South Korea\u2019s relations with Japan. She faced criticism for attending a Japanese reception in Seoul to mark the anniversary of Japan\u2019s military establishment, known as the Self-Defense Forces, and has called for an end to the controversy over Koreans forced to serve as \u201ccomfort women\u201d for Japanese soldiers in World War II. Na, whose daughter has Down syndrome, has led Korean organizations for those with disabilities and chaired the Korean Special Olympics. The debate over South Korean nukes picked up steam when Trump discussed his great relationship not only with Putin but also with Kim, with whom he professed to have fallen \u201cin love\u201d at their summit in Singapore in June 2018. Among the worst concerns is that a future President Trump might try to get Putin to settle for holding on to what he\u2019s got in Ukraine in return for ending the war\u2014and relief from sanctions. Trump, according to this scenario, would resume his love affair with Kim while bargaining for a deal to scale down or even end war games and missile tests. Experts debate, however, the degree to which a nuclear arsenal would contribute to the defense of the South. \u201cWe are all walking into Kim\u2019s political warfare trap,\u201d David Maxwell, a retired army colonel who served five tours in South Korea with the special forces, told The Daily Beast. \u201cNeither U.S. nuclear weapons in the ROK nor the ROK\u2019s development of its own nuclear weapons will significantly contribute to deterrence.\u201d Kim \u201cis looking at these debates with pleasure because they support his major objective of dividing the alliance,\u201d Maxwell said. \u201cThose calling for nuclear weapons in the ROK are supporting KJU\u2019s political warfare strategy and are actually contributing to the weakening of deterrence.\u201d Maxwell is just as skeptical about the return to South Korea of American nukes, which then President George H.W. Bush withdrew in 1991, as he is of the South making its own nuclear weapons. Kim, he believes, \u201cwill simply exploit their presence for his own political warfare campaign\u2026 generating widespread anti-nuclear protests wherever these weapons are located.\u201d Right now, according to a detailed study by Victor Cha, a leading Korea expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, South Koreans are fearful of the international repercussions of going nuclear, including the fallout from withdrawal from the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. A Trump victory in November, however, could bring about a shift that would persuade the South it had to match the North\u2019s nuclear stockpile, estimated at 100 warheads, with nukes of its own. \u201cIf Trump wins and pulls out troops or cuts an ICBM deal with Kim that decouples from short and medium range ballistic missiles,\u201d Cha told The Daily Beast, \u201cthen strategic elite opinions could change\u201d and \u201cpolicy could shift swiftly.\u201d The shift has been underway ever since Kim and Putin hugged at the Vostochny Cosmodrome near the Amur River in Siberia last September and Putin agreed to sell the Russians millions of artillery shells, plus other munitions, for Russian forces in Ukraine. \u201cAfter a lull, South Korea is suddenly talking about going nuclear again,\u201d reports NK News. \u201cLeading conservatives are endorsing nukes to defend against North Korea, reigniting debate about reliance on US military.\u201d Pressure to go nuclear gained urgency after Putin and Kim signed a mutual defense pact in Pyongyang last month, promising to fight for each other in a future war. Assuming Russia \u201cis providing technology\u201d for the North\u2019s satellite program, writes Korea expert Angela Stent at the Brookings Institution in Washington, \u201cRussia may well assist Kim in further developing his nuclear weapons program\u201d\u2014a matter \u201cof great concern to China, South Korea, the United States, and other Asian and European countries.\u201d Revere sees the confrontation cutting both ways. \u201cA lot of domestic polling in the ROK suggests strong popular support for either a nuclear-armed South Korea or the re-introduction of U.S. tactical nuclear weapons into the ROK,\u201d he told The Daily Beast. \u201cThere is a vocal domestic constituency in South Korea that is pushing for the country to go nuclear.\u201d Trump \u201chas made his contempt for Korea and his anti-U.S.-ROK alliance views clear,\u201d Revere observes, and \u201chas spoken positively about his relations with those three dictators\u201d\u2014Kim, Putin and China\u2019s President Xi Jinping. Thus, \u201cone can understand why the anxiety level among South Koreans is high.\u201d However, Revere notes, \u201cNone of the polling that I\u2019ve seen asks Koreans the tough questions about the implications of going nuclear, including the need to withdraw from the NPT, the implications of such a move on South Korea\u2019s international standing, the fact that this would effectively put an end to the goal (however remote) of denuclearizing North Korea.\u201d Then, Revere adds yet another hazard\u2014\u201cthe possibility that anti-alliance MAGA forces\u201d\u2014that is, Trumpsters allied around the slogan, Make America Great Again\u2014\u201cwould seize on this move to reduce the U.S. military commitment or even end the alliance, arguing that Korea can now take care of itself.\u201d Trump, however, is hardly inspiring confidence in the U.S. commitment to defend the South in a second Korean War. \u201cSome believe that the establishment officials in Washington would prevent Trump from pulling US troops from the Korean Peninsula and making other moves that he hinted at,\u201d a former South Korean ambassador to Russia, Wi Sung-lac, told the Korea Herald. \u201c That may have been the case during the first-term Trump administration,\u201d he said, \u201cbut if Trump is back in the White House, things are going to be quite different.\u201d The Herald reported \u201cconservative leaders\u201d as \u201cjoining the hitherto fringe club of politicians calling for South Korea to get its own nuclear weapons to counter growing North Korean and other security threats facing the country.\u201d Or, as one national assembly member, Yu Yong-woon, put it in careful understatement, \u201csecuring potential nuclear capabilities.\u201d",

The fitness guru, who died on July 13 at age 76, has been described as having a \u201cwicked sense of humor\u201d by General Hospital star Lyn Herring after working with the late star when he appeared on the soap in 2013. \u201cRichard Simmons meant a lot to so many folks including me,\u201d Herring, who plays Lucy Coe in General Hospital and shared several scenes with Simmons during his last appearance on the soap, tells PEOPLE. \u201cWhen Richard walked on our General Hospital stage it would sizzle with his life force, his wicked sense of humor, his joy of entertaining and his love for us all,\u201d the actress recalls. \u201cThe last day I worked with him I admired his shirt that had a beautiful jeweled bird on it. When I finished my scenes and came back to my dressing room it was sitting on my couch with a simple Love, Richard.\u201d Herring adds of Simmons, \u201cThank you Richard for all you gave of yourself to so many!\u201d Simmons got his big break in the entertainment industry appearing in General Hospital in 1979 as he played himself on the soap for four years. The fitness guru rejoined the soap one final time in 2013 for the 50th anniversary of the series, appearing in two episodes. The fitness icon died the day after his 76th birthday on Saturday, July 13, his longtime publicist, Tom Estey, confirmed to PEOPLE. He died at his Los Angeles home with no foul play suspected, TMZ first reported. Another of Simmons's colleagues, General Hospital executive producer, Frank Valentini, tells PEOPLE of the late star: \u201cI was so sorry to hear about the passing of Richard Simmons. [He] will always be remembered for bringing a unique brand of humor to General Hospital through his love of fitness and his bigger-than-life personality.\u201d \u201cI was so glad to have an opportunity to experience his energy and enthusiasm firsthand when he came back to help us celebrate our 50th anniversary show. I am sure he is already organizing fitness classes at the campus disco in the sky.

        "text": "With its rulings this term, the Supreme Court created a perfect storm for the lower courts to be inundated with legal challenges on everything from the applications of regulatory laws to the scope of the presidency's power.Taken together, two specific decisions on Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo and Corner Post, Inc. v. Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System combined to create a window for an array of new lawsuits to challenge once-settled law and be reinterpreted by a deeply polarized court. And in the cunning way the high court's conservative majority phrased its decisions, the justices kept the power to clean up the mess for themselves.In a ruling on June 28, the court overturned 40 years of precedent and rolled back the Chevron doctrine. Once considered a victory among conservative lawmakers because it had upheld a deregulatory interpretation of policy by the Reagan administration, the Chevron doctrine gave the Environmental Protection Agency \u2014 and federal agencies more broadly \u2014 the power to interpret ambiguous regulatory language in laws enacted by Congress, as long as the agency's interpretation was reasonable.By rolling Chevron back, the Court decided it should no longer defer to executive branch interpretations of the laws involving its agencies. It has now limited the power of presidentially appointed officials to determine how their agencies should be run under existing laws.\"So that is, in theory, taking power away from unelected officials,\" Justin Crowe, a professor of political science at Williams University who researches the Supreme Court, told Business Insider. \"But, where is that power going? It's not exactly going to the people or to elected officials. In some roundabout sense it might be going to Congress, but in reality, it's going to courts and judges, and giving courts and judges the ability to second-guess agency decisions.\"Under the new rules, federal agencies wouldn't be the authority on the regulations they enforce. That means a plaintiff could challenge regulatory rules and enforcement methods by agencies like the EPA, Securities Exchange Commission, or Department of Health and Human Service, and the Court would be allowed to interpret the legal regulations, potentially clawing back even more power from the executive branch.Corner Post was decided on July 1, receiving less media attention than Loper did several days prior. But, when combined with the outcome of the Loper decision, Corner Post \"almost encourages the targets of administrative regulation to sue,\" according to Jonathan Entin, a retired constitutional law professor at Case Western Reserve University.\"Loper says no deference to the agency; the courts are supposed to interpret regulations. But the Corner Post case, which was a challenge to a Federal Reserve Board regulation about card swiping fees, may encourage loads of legal challenges,\" Entin, who clerked for former Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg while she was in the DC Circuit, said.In the Corner Post case, Entin told BI, the Court expanded the six-year time limit for plaintiffs to bring lawsuits against federal agencies over their regulatory rules. The new limitations are no longer based on when the rule was implemented, as a lower court had determined. Instead, the high court decided the countdown begins when a plaintiff says they were injured by the rule \u2014 which \"opens up every rule for renewed challenges by just anybody,\" Entin said.This means that a plaintiff could sue over a rule enacted decades ago if they can make a case that they were hurt by the regulation within the last six years \u2014 like a newly created gas station suing over emissions regulations that it claims hinder its business, giving the current court a window to reinterpret old law.With Corner Post, Entin said, the Supreme Court created a statute of limitations that, from the standpoint of federal agencies, never really expires.In her dissent in the Corner Post case, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson noted that taken together, the Loper and Corner Post decisions would open up a \"tsunami of lawsuits\" from plaintiffs who have grievances with various federal regulations \u2014 from the Federal Reserve Board's fees for debit card processing to the Environmental Protection Agency's Clean Air Act and beyond. Those inevitable legal challenges will offer the Court ample opportunities to weigh in \u2014 and flex its power \u2014 in the future.But the Court didn't stop at giving itself the reins to interpret regulations that federal agencies are beholden to.The most striking example might be the Supreme Court's ruling in Trump v. United States, in which the court granted widespread immunity to sitting presidents for official actions taken in office. But an insidious element of the Trump case is that it gave the judiciary the power to decide what exactly constitutes an official, protected, action, compared to an unofficial \u2014 and thereby unprotected \u2014 one.In the Trump case, the Supreme Court offered Trump broad immunity for some of his acts concerning his January 6 election interference case. It also kicked some decisions back down to DC District Judge Tanya Chutkan to determine whether other elements of the charges against the former president would be protected by the \"official act\" immunity or if he could still be prosecuted for them.Additional challenges from the Trump camp on Chutkan's decisions could land the case back on the Supreme Court's desk for more specific interpretation.The pattern is not limited to the immunity case or those involving business regulations \u2014 it's part of a trend of the Supreme Court dismantling the non-presidential powers of the executive branch, rolling back laws, and reversing lower court rulings involving guns, emergency abortions, and where homeless people are allowed to sleep.In the July 6 episode of Slate's Supreme Court analysis podcast \"Amicus with Dahlia Lithwick,\" Senior Court Reporter Mark Joseph Stern said the Court spent this term expanding its power and \"restructuring representative democracy to make it less representative and less democratic.\"And it will keep happening no matter who is in the White House.\"It strikes me that this is a court that does not have a modest view of its own role,\" Entin told BI. \"It has reached out to decide things that it didn't necessarily have to decide, and by doing so, it encourages other potential litigants to try to swing for the fences. And whether the court got these cases right or not, I think we're going to see more cases raising these sorts of issues come along.\"",

        "text": "CLEVELAND, Ohio \u2013 Tax bills may be protected from soaring property values, but the county\u2019s recent reappraisal process could still bring huge windfalls to many communities and schools. Ohio law mostly prohibits increases in assessments from generating more taxes. That\u2019s why the recent 32% average increase in residential property values won\u2019t equate to a 32% percent increase in tax bills. HB 920 limits collections on many voted levies. As property values go up, the effective millage rates of levies generally go down to bring in the same amount of money that voters approved. But a portion of the overall tax bill, known as \u201cinside mills,\u201d is different. They\u2019re guaranteed, with fixed rates, so their collections do go up and down directly with inflation. Same goes for some other taxes, like those built into city charters that end up on the tax bill. That means local communities still stand to gain some from the recent sexennial reappraisal process. -- Increases for cities, villages, townships, schools Here is how much more property tax revenue Cuyahoga County estimates each, city, village, township and school district will receive next year as a result of the proposed new property values. These estimates take into account historical trends for tax bills that go unpaid in each community. x - Garfield Heights, citing the rules for one tax in its city charter tied to safety department costs, estimates that its actual increase will be much lower. Not seeing the city-by-city chart above? Some mobile users may need to use this link instead. -- Cleveland\u2019s budget, for example, is expected to get $18 million more in 2025 than it did this year, preliminary estimates provided by the county show. That\u2019s not a huge boost for a city with a $780 million general fund, but it could contribute significantly toward other major funding commitments. The city is currently working to build up the lakefront, negotiate with the Cleveland Browns owners over a potential new stadium and modernize operations at City Hall. It\u2019s too early to say how Cleveland might spend the windfall, according to city spokeswoman Marie Zickefoose. That\u2019s a discussion saved for the budgeting process, when the city knows the real \u201cmagnitude of any revenue growth,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are conducting our own analysis of potential scenarios and how they could impact 2025 revenues and beyond,\u201d Zickefoose said. Cities Lakewood is the next closest earner, with an estimated increase of $6.5 million, followed by Cleveland Heights and Garfield Heights, with increases of $4 million. They\u2019re among 22 communities whose budgets are getting million-dollar boosts, following the reappraisal. Garfield Heights Mayor Matt Burke wasn\u2019t ready to celebrate yet, though. He believes the county\u2019s calculation includes around 20 mills for the city\u2019s \u201caverage pay fund,\u201d which isn\u2019t a fixed rate and only goes toward police, fire and safety forces salaries \u2013 \u201cThat\u2019s why you never see a safety levy come out of Garfield Heights,\u201d he said. It\u2019s something unique to Garfield Heights, which has one of the highest tax rates in the state and received one of the highest property value increases, at 52%. Subtracting those mills would bring the city\u2019s increase in collections closer to $1.3 million. Still, Burke isn\u2019t counting any money until it\u2019s in the bank. \u201cWe don\u2019t pay our bills with estimates,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to see what the real dollars are.\u201d He noted that Garfield Heights residents have been calling \u201ca little frightened\u201d about how they\u2019re going to afford higher property taxes, of any dollar amount. Delinquency in the city was already growing, with collections rates falling in recent years from 92% to 86%, Burke said. He\u2019s bracing for it to drop further next year. \u201cI\u2019m sure that\u2019s got to be on everyone\u2019s mind in Cuyahoga County,\u201d Burke said. Conversely, East Cleveland, which saw the highest appraisal increase at 67%, won\u2019t see much benefit either way. Data show the most it stands to gain from the new valuations is about $378,000. It\u2019s among 37 other communities anticipating boosts of less than $1 million. On the county level, Cuyahoga is expected to rake in an extra $12 million next year, data show. The county won\u2019t know for sure how much it\u2019s getting \u2013 and what it might do with the money \u2013 until after the certification process, spokeswoman Jennifer Ciaccia said. \u201cFluctuations of this size, for both increases and decreases, are common for County revenue sources and will be discussed holistically during the annual budget planning in the fall,\u201d Ciaccia said in an emailed statement. But she noted the figure represents less than 2% of the county\u2019s General Fund. Schools While some property taxes help fund parks, libraries and other public services, the largest share supports schools. They, too, are getting an infusion. Parma City School District will realize the biggest increase, at $14 million, according to the preliminary county estimates. Like Burke, Superintendent Charles Smialek wasn\u2019t ready to commit those dollars. He noted residents can still appeal their valuations, which could reduce the collections. But if the funds come through, he said, it would help the district maintain reasonable class sizes, programming, free sports and full school days \u2013 things that may be in jeopardy if the district continues to project a nearly $6 million deficit in 2027. \u201cWe\u2019ll wait to see what the final numbers are, but we\u2019d fold it into the general fund and make that general fund last as long as possible,\u201d Smialek said. Cleveland Metropolitan School District is estimated to get the next highest increase of $13 million, but officials say it won\u2019t be a saving grace to plug the budget deficit forecasted to begin this year and grow to over $100 million annually by the 2026-2027 school year. \u201cYes, we will receive more property tax revenue, which is good news,\u201d CMSD\u2019s top financial director, James Wright, said. \u201cHowever, this was already factored into our forecast/budget, so it does not improve our financial outlook any further.\u201d The district has been cutting programs and administrative staff and is now seeking two new levies on the November ballot \u2013 one for operating expenses, and a second for capital costs at district buildings. North Royalton City Schools follows with nearly $8 million in additional collections, and Garfield Heights City Schools with nearly $6 million. Most schools, however, fall within a smaller range of $1 to 2 million increases.",

        "text": "Joe Biden\u2019s poor performance in his first 2024 presidential debate with Donald Trump has raised immense concern amongst the Democratic party. Some now believe that it's high time Biden withdraws from the presidential race. Kamala Harris, his VP who has also actively endorsed and campaigned for Biden, has emerged as the main contender to replace him. However, if some reports are to be believed, Harris hasn't been quite popular amongst her staff or her peers. In 2020, a book titled The Truce, authored by Hunter Walker and Luppe B. Luppena, detailed that a former staff offered a harsh review when Harris was named vice president. As reported by The Guardian, the top aide warned, \u201cThis person should not be president of the United States.\u201d For those who don't know, Harris launched her presidential campaign in 2020 but withdrew just a month before the first votes were cast. Her ex-staffer said, \u201cA lot of us, at least folks that I was friends with on the campaign, all realized that, \u2018Yeah, this person should not be president of the United States.\u201d Meanwhile, another aide opined that Harris' backstory was the largest factor that helped her attract supporters. The 59-year-old started the race for the Democratic primary in 2019 and did a good job in the first presidential debate, highlighting her historical stance on 'busing'. Harris had said, \u201cThere was a little girl in California who was part of the second class to integrate her public schools and she was bused to school every day, and that little girl was me.\u201d However, later she struggled to capitalize on policy proposals or launch effective attacks. Several other issues were also pointed out by Walker and Luppen. They shared, \u201cThe problems Harris and her team had experienced on her campaign had persisted during her time as vice president. Harris saw heavy staff turnover, with aides describing a toxic climate riven with factionalism and mismanagement.\" They added, \"One source who worked for the vice president declined to go on record or even discuss matters anonymously, due to the heated atmosphere around the office. They refused to characterize the experience of working for Harris, apart from offering a three-word assessment\u2014\u2018Game of Thrones.\u2019\u201d As reported by The Hill, Harris, today, continues to back the incumbent. Post the debate, she said, \u201cWe always knew this election would be tough, and the past few days have been a reminder that running for president of the United States is never easy.\" She asserted, \u201cBut the one thing we know about our president, Joe Biden, is that he is a fighter. He is a fighter. And he is the first to say, when you get knocked down, you get back up. Many of us know what that is. So we continue to fight. And we will continue to organize. And in November, we will win.\u201d",

        "text": "CLEVELAND -- People all over the country are wringing their hands and asking the same question: How\u2019d we get here? How, in a nation of almost 342 million souls, did our choice for president devolve into a contest between a doddering old guy and a man whom many consider to be a dangerously unhinged blowhard? It\u2019s a question with a thousand theoretical answers, but I\u2019ve got a couple of observations: For one thing, our news media failed us, miserably. The men and women who run our newspaper and broadcast newsrooms, the people who are supposed to be dedicated to bringing us the facts \u201cwithout fear or favor,\u201d in the words of New York Times patriarch Adolph Ochs, generally forfeited that responsibility. Too many of them became dedicated instead to protecting President Joe Biden, in the name of making sure that Donald Trump would not win another term in the White House. That was never more clear than in the aftermath of the Trump/Biden debate on CNN 17 days ago. Since then, Biden\u2019s performance has been variously described by these very news operations as disastrous, alarming, catastrophic, painful, decrepit and infirm, among much else. Biden supporters, in the press and elsewhere, are shocked and dismayed. They have been running for the exits, as a rising cacophony of progressive voices demand that Biden step aside \u2013 or be thrown aside. My question: Where have they been? Biden, as I write this, is having none of it, insisting that he simply had a bad night and is fully capable of charging on. But I\u2019ll tell you the truth. I could not force myself to watch the debate \u2013 in the same way I look away when I pass a car crash. I knew what would happen. Trump would embarrass his supporters by filling the air with lies and bombast. And Biden would appear so pitiable that all I could do would be to hope that none of the country\u2019s enemies were watching. I did record it, though, for later viewing, in case something happened that required watching, and later saw enough to convince me that I\u2019d been only partly right. Trump, for once, generally allowed his opponent\u2019s performance to speak for itself. And Biden was even worse than I expected. All you could do was feel sorry for the man. Advancing age is one thing. What we saw June 27 was something else. What that is, we still don\u2019t know \u2013 but it was someone clearly incapable of doing the job of president. If you\u2019ll forgive me, the thing that comes most powerfully to mind is the old Casablanca clich\u00e9: How on earth could anyone have been \u201cshocked?\u201d I\u2019ll tell you how. Because the newsfolk didn\u2019t do their jobs. People who had been paying only tangential attention, relying on their news sources to tell them if the misgivings about Biden\u2019s age and mental capacity were anything more than partisan sniping, were surprised at how much he appeared to have deteriorated, because they didn\u2019t know. And they didn\u2019t know because their news sources didn\u2019t tell them. It\u2019s not whataboutism to observe that if the candidate who is failing both physically and mentally had been someone most journalists didn\u2019t like, it would have been the big, ongoing story for the last two years. They would be hammering away at his failure to hold press conferences, his shuffling gait and the diminishing acuity that seems clear. But Biden\u2019s political allies were in full denial, writing it off as physical ailments and a long-term speech impediment, and most of the media let them get away with it. Exhibit A is a piece published July 4 on the New York Magazine\u2019s Intelligencer website by Olivia Nuzzi, the magazine\u2019s Washington correspondent. In it, she chronicles what she has seen while covering the White House and talking to Biden\u2019s handlers \u2026 how he reads from a teleprompter for even informal gatherings, is whisked away before anyone can ask him questions, how he sometimes cannot engage in even the simplest conversations and fails to recognize people such as Nuzzi herself whom he has known for years. And the concern over who is actually making presidential decisions. The piece is behind a paywall so you might not be able to access it, but it only costs $4 for a trial subscription. If you\u2019re among those who don\u2019t think Biden should drop out, or if you plan to vote for him anyway, it\u2019ll be the most important four bucks you spend this week. We should have been seeing this information for the last many months, if not the last couple of years. Shame on the reporters who saw it every day and kept it to themselves until it was on full display June 27. If they had not, chances are there\u2019d be some more functional \u2013 and more electable \u2013 Democrat running for president. My second observation is about Trump. You might recall that, in the aftermath of Trump\u2019s surprising (to some) victory over Hillary Clinton in 2016, New York Times Publisher Arthur Sulzberger Jr. and Editor Dean Baquet, both since retired, combined on a mea culpa basically apologizing for missing the biggest story of the election. \u201cDid Donald Trump\u2019s sheer unconventionality lead us and other news outlets to underestimate his support among American voters?\u201d they asked, before pledging \u201cto report America and the world honestly, without fear or favor, striving always to understand and reflect all political perspectives and life experiences in the stories that we bring to you.\u201d Those questions echoed through newsrooms around the country, but I\u2019m not sure many of them made good on their promises to try to better understand what moves people who don\u2019t live on the coasts or in other bastions of the cultural elite. The attraction of Donald Trump, flawed though he is, is no mystery. He gives strong and outraged voice to the many millions of Americans who see unchecked immigrants streaming across our borders, who worry about our diminishing military strength, who worry about Iran\u2019s nuclear capabilities, who are suffering from the inflation caused by the massive COVID giveaways, who think it\u2019s crazy to let biological boys play on girls\u2019 sports teams and use girls\u2019 bathrooms, who resent placing sexually explicit books in children\u2019s libraries, and who are smarting under the many other liberal policies unleashed by the Biden administration. If you want to know why such a man as Trump, crude and loutish though he is, enjoys widespread support and has a chance to regain the White House \u2013 that\u2019s why. And despite the vows of Sulzberger, Baquet and others to do better, that\u2019s the piece that so many journalists and other critics keep missing: Addressing those issues is more important to so many in the heartland than worrying about the dangers of another Trump presidency that so many on the left fear. If Nikki Haley had been elected to address those sensible issues as the Republican nominee, this race would be over. Regrettably, she will not, and it isn\u2019t. So that\u2019s how we got here. Biden vs. Trump. For now. There\u2019s a lot of blame to go around, but here\u2019s what I think: Biden is the only Democrat Trump can beat. And no matter what he says now, it\u2019s hard to imagine that Biden will still be the Democratic candidate come November. Republicans had their chance, and they blew it.

        "text": "In the wake of the news of Saturday's assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump, unfounded conspiracy theories have quickly emerged, suggesting that the shooting was staged.The incident, which took place during a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, has left many shocked and prompted a wave of speculation.One rally attendee was killed and two others were critically injured, according to the Secret Service, who neutralized and killed the shooter. He has been named by the FBI as Thomas Matthew Crooks.The attempt occurred as Trump was addressing a large crowd of supporters. A gunman fired shots in the direction of the former president, who was then swiftly removed from the stage by Secret Service agents. Trump appeared injured and was taken to hospital, the suspect was apprehended and killed at the scene.Almost immediately, social media platforms and various online forums were flooded with posts alleging that the entire incident was a hoax. Proponents of these theories argue that the attack was orchestrated to garner sympathy or admiration for Trump and boost his support ahead of the 2024 presidential election.Hodgetwins posted a video on X, formerly Twitter, of Trump standing up dazed, bleeding and defiant after the shooting, with the caption: \"Trump just got shot in the head and got up like a gangster and fist pumped.\"Reposting the same video and caption, user @jawn commented in all caps: \"This is the most staged s*** I've ever seen. An active shooter and Secret Service just allows him to stand back up for a fist up?! The crowd just sits back down?? Crowd just smiles and takes pictures??\"Another user responded saying: \"I totally agree!! Ten shots were fired and he's just up like this. What happened to the shooter?\"X user @awsten reposted the same footage on the platform, writing again in all caps: \"Nothing has ever been more staged, pushing off Secret Service who are much stronger than him to put a fist in the air for the cameras. This is not a marvel movie, you are not Iron Man.\"In response, another user commented: \"At minimum he put the Secret Service at risk to stall and pump his fist in the air.\"\"That shooting so staged, they clipped Trump's ear with a damn rubber bullet,\" stated another user Ty-Rin.Several X users appeared to mock Trump's reaction. One, SJ, said: \"They staged that and he bladed when they jumped on him. I'm familiar with this WWE a** script.\"User @jaybands24 responded: \"They tryna get Trump a face redemption ark so everyone roots for him I see thru it.\"In response, several X users debunked the conspiracy theories with @mavsmerle commenting: \"Saying this is staged is just weird considering the fact that one of the attendees was just pronounced dead and so was the shooter.\"This comment relates to the confirmed death of one rally attendee and the shooter himself.",

During the red carpet event on Saturday, July 13, the model, 50, stepped out at UCLA\u2019s Pauley Pavilion wearing a vibrant multi-colored layered tassle dress. Photographed spinning on the red carpet in the eye-catching halterneck dress, Klum wore her hair in loose waves and accessorized the look with some statement earrings and shimmery nude glam. Klum was attending the event as a nominee for America\u2019s Got Talent \u2014 for which she serves as host alongside Simon Cowell, Howie Mandel and Sofia Vergara. The show won the favorite reality show award on the night. Ahead of the event the model posted several updates on her Instagram Stories, showing her getting her hair styled for the event, receiving a cake from Vergara and heading to the awards in a car, showing off her neon pink manicure. Attending the Kids' Choice Awards is a common tradition for the Klum family. Just last year, she also attended as a nominee, as America's Got Talent was nominated once again for favorite reality show. She sported a skirt and top from Moschino that featured lots of hearts \u2014 and showed off her abs. Speaking with PEOPLE during the red carpet portion of the ceremony last year, the former Victoria's Secret Angel opened up about her daughter Leni, saying that she is \"very proud\" that Leni was studying interior design in college while pursuing her own modeling career. \"I'm very proud of my daughter and her modeling,\" said Klum. \"And she's studying at the same time, she's juggling already.\" According to the Hollywood Reporter, Nickelodeon announced that this year's hosts will be SpongeBob Squarepants and Patrick Star (SpongeBob is voiced by Tom Kenny and Patrick is voiced by Bill Fagerbakke), in celebration of the animated series' 25th anniversary season, after first airing in 1999. Back in May, Nickelodeon said the Kids' Choice Awards \"will take place in an animated setting through enhanced graphics and advanced augmented reality,\" according to THR. The network added that this marks the first time that animated characters have hosted a full-length awards show.

        "text": "is one of, if not the most anticipated titles set to launch in 2025, and Rockstar's legions of fans have speculated endlessly on what the game will entail since long before its reveal trailer at the tail-end of 2023. With the prospect of a dual protagonist storyline for GTA 6, there is some credence to the theory that Lucia and Jason will inevitably face an irreconcilable crossroads akin to the rift that fractured the Van Der Linde gang in Red Dead Redemption 2. GTA 6 will be Rockstar's first game since 2018, and its first entry in the GTA franchise in just over a decade. Given RDR 2's nuanced attention to detail and unparalleled fidelity through enhancements to the studio's in-house RAGE engine, the stage is set for GTA 6 to be one of the most impressive technical showcases in gaming's history. Based in a fictional version of South Florida, its debut trailer gave a glimpse into a world that has captured the region's zeitgeist through the lens of Rockstar's trademark sardonic satire. Lessons in Criminal History that GTA 6 Should Learn From As paramours and partners in crime, the debut of Jason and Lucia as GTA 6's main players has oft drawn the comparison of Bonnie and Clyde. While their portrayal may tread similar ground, up to and including its tragic end, Rockstar's past narrative precedent could veer wildly down a different path. GTA 5 juggled a three-protagonist structure aptly, and though the canonical ending has them all riding off into the sunset, the player is given the option for a divergent ending where either Michael or Trevor are stabbed in the back. More recently, RDR 2 features a slow-burn dissolving of trust between Arthur Morgan and Dutch Van Der Linde, culminating in a vicious betrayal between a band of thieves that had been like family beforehand. Betrayal is a resonant and powerful plot device, and though GTA 6's trailer paints Lucia and Jason as inextricably linked, that relationship may be severed by the game's outset. In the crime thriller genre, backstabbing is a common trope. It is a safe bet to presume GTA 6 will feature at least one betrayal over the course of its story, but whether that comes at the hands of a side character like Darko Brevic in GTA 4, or one of the main cast such as Dutch in RDR 2, is up in the air. Beyond the romance and a shared instinct for criminal enterprise, the depths of Jason and Lucia's relationship were not explored by GTA 6's trailer, and if the first act of the game includes the origin of their entanglement, it might be foreshadowing some third act treachery. GTA 6 Needs to Set Itself Apart Another hint that may be considered grasping at straws is the trailer's introduction of Lucia, who appears to be recently out on parole. In the clip, she stares plaintively out her cell window, transitioning to a conversation with who is presumably her probation officer. That plot point could just be written as a signifier of Lucia's criminal acumen, but it could also be the caveat that creates the rift between her and Jason at some point in GTA 6's plot. Whether Jason and Lucia eventually turn on one another, or stick it out through thick and thin, the sneak peek of GTA 6's beautifully irreverent world has left its fans anxious for more. The months leading to its eventual release will shed some light on how its story will unfold, as well as its ambitious plans for the next iteration of GTA Online, but until then, the only leads to go off of are the patterns of the studio's past titles.",

        "text": "ABU DHABI, United Arab Emirates -- Calling it a \"terrible\" and \"demoralizing day for our country,\" Team USA coach Steve Kerr tried to summarize the emotions of his team Sunday as it is halfway across the world representing their nation in the wake of an assassination attempt on former president Donald Trump. \"This is a time where we feel very proud to represent our country wearing USA on our chest, competing in the Olympics,\" Kerr said. \"We've talked to the players about how important it's to show the best version of us as human beings to represent our country in a respectful, dignified manner. It makes you want to do that even more so, because this is really shameful for us to sit here and think about what happened and what's going on in our country.\" Kerr, whose father Malcolm was assassinated in 1984 in Beirut, Lebanon, has a long history of criticizing gun violence. \"It's such a demoralizing day for our country, and it's yet another example of not only our political division, but also gun culture,\" Kerr said. \"A 20-year-old with an AR-15 trying to shoot the former president. It's hard to process everything and it's scary to think about where this goes because of the issues that already exist in the country. So this is a terrible day. \"Thank God Trump wasn't hit, but it's just so demoralizing in every which way.\" Early Sunday morning, the FBI identified the suspected gunman as 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks. In a statement, the FBI said \"this remains an active and ongoing investigation.\" Players and coaches learned of the events in Butler, Pennsylvania, when they awoke to the news Sunday morning. \"It's obviously very sad time in general. All the conversations around the election and the state of politics in our country, and then you have a situation like this, which just invokes a lot of emotions around things that we need to correct as a people,\" Team USA star Stephen Curry said. \"Obviously gun control first and foremost, because the fact that that's even possible for somebody to to have an attack like that. But just moreso you want to [see] positivity and hope. It sounds cheesy, but it's real. That's when our country's at its best and it just adds another blemish to what's going on. So sad is just the word.\" Team USA was addressed by U.S. Ambassador to the United Arab Emirates Martina Strong in a prescheduled event Sunday. The team will remain in the Middle East this week before playing Olympic preparation games against Australia on Monday and Serbia on Wednesday. \"Obviously what we're doing is very trivial, just playing basketball, but we want to put our best selves out there to try to give people a glimpse of what our country can be about,\" Kerr said. \"And then you hear something like this and it's just so demoralizing and obviously so sad.\"",

        "text": "It's unacceptably trite to say that we knew something like this would happen. But on some level, how could we not? Despite the expressions of sympathy and support from both Donald Trump's allies and his most committed political opponents, and the ritual pronouncements that political violence is unacceptable, no one in America can truly be surprised by each new outbreak of mayhem and bloodshed, whether it occurs on the streets of a large city, inside a rural church or a suburban big-box retail store, or at a presidential campaign rally in post-industrial western Pennsylvania. It appears that Trump was not seriously injured in a probable assassination attempt in Butler, Pennsylvania, on Saturday evening. He posted on Truth Social that he \"was shot with a bullet that pierced the upper part of my right ear.\" Two other people have died in this incident, according to local officials. One of them was the presumed shooter, reportedly killed by the Secret Service, and the other was a person not yet identified at the time of writing, very likely a rally attendee who was shot accidentally. Two additional spectators were injured, according to the Secret Service. In other words, what happened in Butler was bad enough, and it could have been much worse. What is about to happen will very likely be even more damaging, as we move from fragmentary news reporting into the realm of speculation, name-calling, finger-pointing, conspiracy theory and half-baked political forecasting. Any pause in the 2024 presidential campaign following this incident will be brief: The Republican National Convention begins on Monday in Milwaukee, and Trump is scheduled to accept the party's nomination in a nationally televised speech on Thursday evening. We may or may not learn salient facts about the alleged Pennsylvania shooter and their motivations in the days to come, but it is not overly cynical to say that the facts about such events barely matter. Consider what we know, or believe we know, about the police killing of George Floyd, the near-fatal attack on Paul Pelosi or the mass shootings burned into our collective memory in Uvalde or Parkland or Sandy Hook. Consider the national Rorschach test of Jan. 6, 2021, an event that for millions of Americans has been transformed from one kind of thing to another, from an outrageous violation to a heroic act of resistance. For that matter, consider the assassinations of John F. Kennedy, Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert F. Kennedy in the 1960s, which remain the source of unresolved national trauma and a wellspring for unified-field conspiracy theories of every possible variety. None of those events, or dozens of others we could name, can adequately be explained or consigned to the past with the help of psychoanalysis or political screeds on Facebook or the tortured manifestos left behind by murderers. To a large extent, we never really know what drives people to commit acts of irrational violence \u2014 or, to put it more accurately, we are overloaded with too many reasons, and we all get to pick the ones that support our existing worldview. So it will be, unhappily for our rapidly decomposing polity, with this apparent assassination attempt against Donald Trump. We live in the worst possible version of a choose-your-own-adventure video game, powerless to control events but endlessly free to concoct our own hidden messages and secret meanings, based on whatever actual or invented evidence we like. It wasn't surprising that as soon as reports emerged that shots had been fired at Trump, social media erupted with outlandish allegations that Joe Biden had ordered a hit on his nemesis or, conversely, that the incident was a false-flag operation meant to cast blame on Trump-hating liberals and provoke a wave of sympathy for the recently-convicted ex-president. In the days ahead, liberal or left-leaning pundits will no doubt soberly propose that the MAGA movement brought this event on itself by constantly invoking a fascist-flavored rhetoric of violent retribution. Conservatives will counter that this attack was the result of Trump derangement syndrome and the left's congenital contempt for the desires and yearnings of \"real Americans.\" Want a daily wrap-up of all the news and commentary Salon has to offer? Subscribe to our morning newsletter, Crash Course. Blaming the outbreaks of unhinged violence that make American society virtually unique in the world on one political faction, one socioeconomic group or one cultural grouping strikes me as missing the point entirely. We \u2014 if there is still a \"we,\" which is open to doubt \u2014 created this tragic, farcical situation, in which two elderly candidates no one particularly likes are running against each other in an election most of us dread, and someone tried to kill one of them this weekend for reasons we simultaneously do not understand and understand all too well. We all did that. We traveled to this bad place together, which means, in theory, that we can still decide to go somewhere else, and be different than this. We might start by not saying things that are blatantly and outrageously untrue, whenever something like this happens. Bill Clinton posted a message on X late on Saturday that began, \"Violence has no place in America.\" What can that possibly mean, coming from a person who spent eight years as the actual president of a nation that was born in violence and has been infused with violence throughout its existence, and which has inflicted immense violence on its own people, its perceived enemies and an unknowable number of innocent people around the world? Many other people said essentially the same thing, of course: It's a ritual refusal to tell the truth or look in the mirror, as counterfactual and illogical as any of the magical thinking found in organized religion. What happened in Butler, Pennsylvania, on Saturday night \u2014 whomever we want to blame for it and whatever explanations we want to concoct \u2014 was quintessentially American, an act drawn from our national history, our national heritage, our national soul. Face that fact honestly, and maybe we can get somewhere.",

        "text": "Gov. Josh Green faces only bad options in making an interim appointment to fill a vacant West Oahu state Senate seat, and his plan to wait until after the Aug. 10 primary election is a fair solution \u2014 even if it bends the law. Democratic Sen. Maile Shimabukuro resigned May 31 from her District 22 seat (Ko Olina, Nanakuli, Maili, Waianae, Makaha, Makua) in the apparent hope Green would appoint her preferred successor, state Rep. Cedric Gates, to finish the term and have the edge of running as the incumbent in the Democratic primary against former Rep. Stacelynn Eli to fill the seat permanently. But Green balked at taking sides in the primary. He said he wouldn\u2019t fill the seat until afterward even though it runs afoul of a legal requirement that he fill vacancies within 60 days, which would be July 30, from three candidates provided by the Democratic Party. The party\u2019s list included Gates, Eli and Cross Makani Crabbe, Gates\u2019 office manager, who is running in a crowded primary for the House seat Gates is leaving. Green complained the party didn\u2019t give him the option to appoint an interim senator not running in the primary. He said his higher obligation under the state Constitution is to ensure fair elections by letting voters decide without his thumb on the scale. Senate President Ron Kouchi objected, however, and demanded Green follow the law. The governor said if he\u2019s forced to make an appointment on July 30 he\u2019ll name Crabbe, which would keep the Senate race level but potentially influence the House election. As Shakespeare might say, Green is hoist with his own petard. A governor once could choose whomever he or she wished as interim legislator, as long as the appointee was from the same political party as the departed lawmaker. But when Linda Lingle was elected Hawaii\u2019s first Republican governor in 40 years, the Democratic Legislature, which included Green, passed laws to handcuff her \u2014 including the rule that interim legislators come from a party-supplied list. Green ended up handcuffing himself. In another irony, Kouchi was among the first beneficiaries of the change, in a situation similar to today\u2019s. He joined the Senate in 2010 when Lingle named him from the party\u2019s list shortly before his primary against John Yamane for a Kauai seat vacated by Gary Hooser. Kouchi\u2019s objections to Green\u2019s move are as much about Senate politics as the law. In the factionalized Senate it\u2019s always challenging for leaders to keep control. Shimabukuro was a Kouchi supporter and sought to hand him a like-minded successor. Green\u2019s refusal to play ball likely has a bit to do with the Kouchi group\u2019s bullying of his appointees last session. Any or all interim candidates could end this by dropping out and asking the party to give Green candidates not on the primary ballot. District 22 could be represented immediately, and voters could choose the permanent senator from a level field. Otherwise, the best of the bad choices is to allow Green to use reasonable judgment to keep this election fair. Then amend the law, as he suggests, to pause future interim legislative appointments within 120 days of elections. Reach David Shapiro at volcanicash@gmail.com.",

        "text": "Can they pick up where they left off? The last time we saw the University of Hawaii football team, the Warriors had just pulled off a senior night semi-miracle at Ching field. The Warriors modeled efficiency and poise under pressure with Matthew Shipley\u2019s 51-yard game-winning field goal as the clock ran out against Colorado State, and UH won 27-24. Hawaii won three of its last four games to save what looked like a lost season after its 35-0 homecoming debacle against San Jose State put UH at 2-7, killing any slim remaining hopes for a winning record. But Warriors fans had reasons to be encouraged by the late-season surge that included a 27-13 upset of Air Force, which had come into the game at 8-1 and leading the Mountain West. It was as if the Warriors finally found their alarm clock and a sense of urgency, scoring on their first possession of the game for the first time all season. In many settings, our culture\u2019s leisurely pace that includes a lack of stress over punctuality is comfortable and pleasing. But the football field isn\u2019t the place for that. Comeback victories are thrilling. Most fans, though, prefer domination from the start \u2014 especially if pulling out wins at the end also means losses that would have been victories with better play earlier in the game. Quarterback Brayden Schager completed his first 10 passes in that Air Force game. He\u2019s always had a strong arm, but he became much more effective when quarterback runs became more a part of UH\u2019s game plan, not just desperate scrambles. Hawaii\u2019s offense should be very good this year when you consider that Schager and most of his favorite passing targets \u2014 most notably, Pofele Ashlock, Steven McBride and Koali Nishigaya \u2014 have returned. It could be excellent if someone steps up at running back. Schager running can be a good thing, but you definitely don\u2019t want your quarterback the only running threat. As for defense, the biggest key is turnovers. The Warriors generated only 13 last season. If the offense plays like it did toward the end of 2023, it won\u2019t need a lot of time to put up points \u2014 but, of course, it needs the ball. If linebacker Logan Taylor is back to full health, he and an athletic, physical secondary might produce more fumbles and interceptions. The 2023 Warriors were a little bit like their coach\u2019s team during his senior year, in that they were late bloomers, too. Twenty years ago, quarterback Timmy Chang broke a bunch of passing records, including career yards and touchdowns. Still, the Warriors were 4-5 after blowout losses at Boise State and Fresno State (and a season-opening defeat against Florida Atlantic, where Craig Angelos, who is now Chang\u2019s boss, was then athletic director). But after a 70-14 drubbing at Fresno, the Warriors ran the table. They closed out with wins against Idaho, Northwestern and Michigan State, and then knocked off UAB in the Hawaii Bowl. Now, after just two seasons, Chang is one of the longest-tenured head coaches in the Mountain West. If that\u2019s not weird enough, how about this \u2014 UCLA is in the Big Ten, and Washington State is in the \u2026 well, whatever they\u2019re in, or not in, we know the Cougs are on the Warriors schedule. Other than at Pullman on Oct. 19 and the Bruins here on Aug. 31, Hawaii\u2019s nonconference schedule looks extremely manageable. As for the Mountain West, last season UH showed it could beat the conference\u2019s top team, and the Warriors finished with that flourish against the Rams. Yes, that was last year \u2014 and Shipley, the star kicker, left via the transfer portal. Hawaii will have to show that momentum means something after eight months, especially considering how drastically things change in college football from the end of one season to the start of the next, much more than they used to.",

        "text": "The FBI has identified Thomas Matthew Crooks, a 20-year-old man from western Pennsylvania, as the person who attempted to assassinate former President Donald Trump at a campaign event in Butler, Pennsylvania, on Saturday. Crooks reportedly shot Trump during a rally in the small town, striking the upper part of Trump\u2019s right ear while the former president was speaking to rallygoers ahead of next week\u2019s Republican National Convention in Milwaukee. One attendee was killed and two others were injured during the incident, the agency said, and Crooks was shot dead. The victims have not been identified yet. ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT ON TRUMP AT PENNSYLVANIA RALLY LEAVES 2 HURT, 2 DEAD, INCLUDING SHOOTER \"The FBI has identified Thomas Matthew Crooks, 20, of Bethel Park, Pennsylvania, as the subject involved in the assassination attempt of former President Donald Trump on July 13, in Butler, Pennsylvania,\" the FBI said in a statement to Fox News Digital. \"This remains an active and ongoing investigation.\" Crooks, 20, was from Bethel Park, which is a Pittsburgh suburb about an hour south from where the assassination attempt took place. Crooks reportedly graduated from Bethel Park High School in 2022. He was one of nearly two dozen students from the school to earn a $500 \"star award\" from the National Math and Science Initiative. An online recording of his graduation ceremony shows him walking the stage with minimal applause and briefly posing with a school official, the New York Times reported. SUSPECTED TRUMP ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT SHINES LIGHT ON RALLY SECURITY A search by Fox News Digital revealed Crooks would have turned 21 years old this September. He had no reported criminal or traffic citations and no reported bankruptcies, liens or foreclosures. Crooks was a registered Republican, according to voting records, but had only participated in the Nov. 8, 2022, state election due to his age. Voting records also don't detail who a person votes for. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The FBI says it will continue its investigation into Crooks and any other information it can obtain. \"This remains an active and ongoing investigation, and anyone with information that may assist with the investigation is encouraged to submit photos or videos online at FBI.gov/butler or call 1-800-CALL-FBI,\" the statement continued.

By Leo Kamin, Contributor A spoiler poised to hand the election to Trump? An appealing alternative to Biden? An antidote to two-party rule? Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the independent presidential candidate, is many things to many people. No surprise, then, that his richest donors are a diverse group. Worth a combined $37 billion, these tycoons include once-dependable Democrats, political newcomers and some of Trump\u2019s biggest backers. Together, they\u2019ve seeded RFK Jr.\u2019s longshot bid with $39 million, funding a Super Bowl ad and underwriting a frantic effort to get JFK\u2019s nephew on the ballot in all 50 states. It would take a lot more money to actually return a Kennedy to the White House, but $39 million could nonetheless be enough to affect whether Biden or Trump ends up there. 1. Timothy Mellon Donations to Kennedy groups: $25 million | Net worth: Nearly $1 billion The Mellons and Kennedys, American dynasties associated with opposite political parties, summered together on Cape Cod in the 1960s. More than a half-century later, Timothy Mellon, who grew his inheritance in the railroad industry, is the biggest supporter of Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\u2019s candidacy. That doesn\u2019t necessarily mean he wants RFK Jr. to win. Mellon has invested more than three times as much into Donald Trump\u2019s effort to reclaim the White House. Gonzalo Marroquin/Getty Images/Gold House 2. Nicole Shanahan (ex-spouse of Sergey Brin) Donations to Kennedy groups: $14 million | Net worth: $300 million+ Kennedy\u2019s running mate is also his second-biggest donor. The ex-wife of Google cofounder Sergey Brin, Shanahan appears to have received at least 2.6 million shares of Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, in her divorce. If she held onto them, those shares would be worth nearly $500 million today. Shanahan gave thousands to Hillary Clinton in 2016 and even more to support Biden in 2020. But she was drawn to Kennedy, especially his ideas about chronic illness, which\u2013Shanahan believes\u2013can be caused by things like microplastics, electromagnetic pollution and prescription medications. \u201cAs Bobby says, we need to investigate every possible cause of the chronic disease epidemic that is devouring our nation from the inside,\u201d Shanahan said in a March 2024 speech. She ended up pouring $4 million to air a Super Bowl ad supporting Kennedy earlier this year, according to the New York Times. In March, Kennedy selected her as his running mate, allowing her to inject unlimited sums directly into the campaign. Since then, she has spent $10 million. Rick Kern/WireImage/Getty Images 3. John Paul DeJoria Donations to Kennedy groups: $6,600 | Net worth: $3 billion DeJoria, a former door-to-door salesman who once lived out of a 20-year-old Rolls-Royce, cofounded the hair-care giant John Paul Mitchell Systems in 1980 with just $700. Nine years later, he started Patr\u00f3n, a premium tequila brand he sold to Bacardi in 2018. DeJoria is a prolific philanthropist, and he also shares his fortune with politicians\u2014mostly Republicans from his adopted home state of Texas. His connection to RFK Jr. runs deep, though. DeJoria is a trustee of Kennedy\u2019s Waterkeeper Alliance, one of multiple environmental efforts the billionaire has bankrolled. DeJoria chipped in $6,600 last September to support Kennedy, the first presidential candidate to receive a DeJoria donation since Jeb Bush. Stefanie Keenan/Getty Images/PSLA 4. Holly Gores (spouse of Tom Gores) Donations to Kennedy groups: $6,600 | Net worth: $9.1 billion Leon Bennett/Getty Images 5. Kelly Gores (spouse of Alec Gores) Donations to Kennedy groups: $6,600 | Net worth: $2.2 billion Sisters-in-law Holly and Kelly Gores are not megadonors, but they certainly have plenty of money to spend. Holly is married to Tom Gores, the owner of the Detroit Pistons. Kelly is married to his brother Alec. The Los Angeles-based siblings once worked together on buyouts before striking it out on their own with separate private-equity firms. Their wives have both donated $6,600 to Kennedy\u2019s campaign, the most any noncandidate can give directly to a campaign. So far, they have not handed over bigger sums to Kennedy\u2019s super-PAC, which is allowed to accept donations of any size. Patrick McMullan/Getty Images 6. Bill Ackman Donations to Kennedy groups: $3,300 | Net worth: $9.3 billion The hedge fund manager who helped oust Harvard president Claudine Gay has mostly donated to Democrats over the years. But he has been hesitant about Biden. Ackman backed RFK Jr. and Congressman Dean Phillips, who both launched Democratic primary bids against the president. In May, Ackman said in a lengthy post on X that he would not vote for Biden, who he had previously criticized for his Israel policy and mental acuity. \u201cI am seriously considering @RFK and @realDonaldTrump,\u201d he explained. On the night of the debate, however, Ackman encouraged the country to \u201crally around Trump.\u201d Paul Morigi/Getty Images 7. Elizabeth Uihlein Donations to Kennedy groups: $3,300 | Net worth: $6.6 billion The cofounder of an industrial-supplies giant, Uihlein is a stalwart Republican\u2013and one of Trump\u2019s biggest benefactors. She hasn\u2019t always been on the Trump train, though. Uihlein donated $1.5 million to a pro-Ron DeSantis super-PAC last year and doled out smaller contributions to the campaigns of Mike Pence, Vivek Ramaswamy and RFK Jr. Uihlein seems firmly committed to Trump now, though. She hasn\u2019t donated anything to Kennedy since he dropped out of the Democratic primary and announced his third-party bid. In May, Uihlein and her husband Dick each handed Trump\u2019s super-PAC $5 million. 8. Lisa Troutt (spouse of Kenny Troutt) Donations to Kennedy groups: $2,500 | Net worth: $1.7 billion Troutt and her husband, Texas telecom billionaire Kenny Troutt, have been dependable sources of cash for Republicans for years. They gave generously to support Trump in 2016 and 2020, and they\u2019ve continued to stand with Trump this time around, pouring over $1 million into groups that support him. The couple tend to give together, but only Lisa contributed to Kennedy, giving him $2,500 in September of last year, two months after the pair donated $500,000 to Trump\u2019s PAC. The Kennedy contribution did not signal a move away from the 45th president: Lisa Troutt went on to give over $400,000 to a pro-Trump committee in March. Dean Hanson/ZUMA Press/Newscom 9. Ron Corio Donations to Kennedy groups: $2,000 | Net worth: $1.7 billion The solar energy pioneer, New Mexico\u2019s only billionaire, has long kept a low profile. He gave a few thousand to Clinton in 2016 and Biden in 2020 and has consistently supported his state\u2019s Democratic representatives, but he tends not to speak publicly about politics. Corio\u2019s recent donations suggest that he is unsatisfied with the top of the Democratic ticket. Though he has continued to support New Mexico\u2019s liberal senator, his only other contributions this cycle are a pair of $1,000 checks to Kennedy\u2019s campaign in March and May, He also gave more than $250,000 to Andrew Yang\u2019s third-party alternative, the Forward Party. Dia Dipasupil/Getty Images/Lincoln Center 10. Bridget Koch (spouse of Bill Koch) Donations to Kennedy groups: $1,000 | Net worth: $2 billion Bridget Koch is married to Bill Koch, who came out on the wrong side of a lengthy legal dispute with his brothers Charles and David (d. 2019) for control of the family\u2019s industrial conglomerate, one of the largest private companies in America. Bill\u2019s wife Bridget had been a consistent conservative, never donating the sums of her famous brothers-in-law but supporting Trump in 2016 and 2020. She may have soured on MAGA, though. In the last two years, she hasn\u2019t donated to support Trump, or any other Republicans. The only federal contribution she has disclosed, in fact, was a $1,031.24 check to Kennedy\u2019s campaign last June.

I\u2019m grateful to hear that he\u2019s safe and doing well. I\u2019m praying for him and his family and for all those who were at the rally, as we await further information. Jill and I are grateful to the Secret\u2026Kamala Harris condemned the \"abhorrent act\" and said that she was praying for Trump, his family, and \"all those who have been injured and impacted by this senseless shooting.\"\"Violence such as this has no place in our nation,\" she added.The newly-elected UK Prime Minister said he was \"appalled\" by the incident, adding that \"political violence in any form has no place in our societies and my thoughts are with all the victims of this attack.\"Israel's Prime Minister, Netanyahu, said that he and his wife were \"shocked\" by the incident and that they were praying for Trump's recovery.Sara and I were shocked by the apparent attack on President Trump. We pray for his safety and speedy recovery.Canada's head of state said he was \"sickened\" by the shooting.\"My thoughts are with former President Trump, those at the event, and all Americans,\" he added.Macron called the assassination attempt a \"tragedy for our democracies.\"\"France shares the shock and indignation of the American people,\" he added.Ukraine's wartime president said he was \"appalled\" to hear about the shooting and said that \"such violence has no justification and no place anywhere in the world.\"\"I wish America emerges stronger from this,\" he added.Obama called on people to use the incident \"to recommit ourselves to civility and respect in our politics.\"\"Although we don't yet know exactly what happened, we should all be relieved that former President Trump wasn't seriously hurt,\" he wrote on X.There is absolutely no place for political violence in our democracy. Although we don\u2019t yet know exactly what happened, we should all be relieved that former President Trump wasn\u2019t seriously hurt, and use this moment to recommit ourselves to civility and respect in our politics.\u2026Olaf Scholz, the chancellor of Germany, called the attack \"despicable.\"\"My thoughts are also with all of those who were affected by the attack. Such acts of violence threaten democracy,\" he said.India's Prime Minister said he was concerned about the attack on his \"friend\" and strongly condemned the incident.\"Violence has no place in politics and democracies. Wish him speedy recovery,\" Modi wrote on X.Meloni said of Trump: \"My solidarity and my best wishes for a speedy recovery go to him, with the hope that the next few months of the electoral campaign will see dialogue and responsibility prevail over hatred and violence.\"Seguo con apprensione gli aggiornamenti dalla Pennsylvania, dove il 45esimo Presidente degli Stati Uniti @realDonaldTrump \u00e8 stato colpito durante un comizio.

Crooks was immediately \u201cneutralized\u201d by the Secret Service, according to the FBI. WHO IS THOMAS CROOKS? Crooks is from Bethel Park, Pennsylvania, a relatively affluent, predominantly white suburb of of Pittsburgh, about 42 miles away from Butler, where the Trump rally took place. Allegheny County voter records listed a Thomas Matthew Crooks as a registered Republican, according to multiple news reports. When Crooks was 17, according to Reuters, he made a $15 contribution to Act Blue, a political action committee that raises money for Democratic candidates. The donation was earmarked for the Progressive Turnout Project, according to Federal Election Commission in 2021 filings cited by Reuters. Crooks graduated from Bethel Park High School in 2022 and was awarded a National Maths and Science Initiative Star Award worth $500. Law enforcement vehicles were stationed outside a residence listed at the address on Crooks' voter registration record, according to USA Today. Agents from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives were on the scene and a bomb squad was at the residence. The perimeter of the residence of the suspect was guarded on Sunday by yellow police caution tape. An Alleghany County Police vehicle was parked outside. THE ATTACK During the attack, Crooks wore a gray T-shirt with an American flag on the sleeve, matching merchandise sold by the popular YouTube firearm channel Demolition Ranch. The channel has over 11 million subscribers and frequently posts videos about various types of weaponry. During the rally, the alleged shooter was positioned on the roof of a building approximately 130 yards from the stage where Trump was speaking. Witnesses described seeing Crooks moving across the roof before the attack. A New York Times audio analysis reported there were two bursts of shots\u2014a round of three followed by a round of five. The shots appeared to have been fired roughly 330 to 390 feet from the microphone that was recording the audio, according to the Times analysis. Crooks fired the shots outside the area secured by the Secret Service. Following the shots, the Secret Service immediately \u201cneutralized\u201d Crooks. ONGOING INVESTIGATION Law enforcement officials have not dismissed the possibility that Crooks acted alone, and they are investigating suspicious packages found near the gunman\u2019s location. Kevin Rojek, special agent in charge at the FBI Pittsburgh field office, said investigators are still determining the motive behind the shooting. FAMILY REACTION When reached by CNN late Saturday night, Crooks\u2019 father, Matthew Crooks, said he was trying to figure out \u201cwhat the hell is going on\u201d but would \u201cwait until I talk to law enforcement\u201d before speaking about his son.",

Thank God it s not in the US, then I d be really concerned, said Eshkol. Surrounded by an Iranian ring of fire and battling simultaneously on multiple fronts, Israelis can be excused for giving less attention these days to their country s dependence on America s welfare. Israeli ground forces are operating within Rafah and other densely populated urban areas in Gaza against Iran-backed Hamas. Hamas diabolical strategy of using Palestinian civilians as human shields ensures that Israel s legitimate efforts to defend itself against the jihadists expressed genocidal aims will cause extensive injury and death to Palestinian civilians and leave Gazan civilian infrastructure in ruins. The photos of civilian suffering have, as Hamas intended, inflicted a terrible blow on Israel s reputation, which has sunk to new lows in the court of international public opinion. Meanwhile, Iran-backed Hezbollah s daily aerial assaults beginning shortly after Hamas Oct. 7 massacre of some 1,200, mostly civilian Israelis and including Americans, and kidnapping of approximately 240 others, mostly civilian Israelis and including Americans compelled Israel to evacuate a five-kilometer-wide swath of sovereign territory along its northern border and prepare for a high-intensity war. And Iran has equipped proxies in Syria, Iraq, and Yemen with long-range drones and missiles. Notwithstanding Israel s focus on its soldiers, its kidnapped citizens, and its homeland, the nation s fight against Hamas, Hezbollah, other Iranian proxies and Iran itself remains bound up with American power and prosperity. Lacking a comprehensive domestic weapons industry, Israel acquires fighter aircraft, a wide range of munitions, and other essential military equipment from the United States. Israel s fortunes at the United Nations, in the International Court of Justice and the International Criminal Court, and among nations turn in no small measure on the tone set, judgments issued, and actions taken by the United States. And should war with heavily armed Hezbollah broaden into a regional conflict which may well include waves of Iranian-launched attack drones, cruise missiles, and ballistic missiles Washington s decision about whether and how to intervene would have major ramifications for Israel. Hence, American politics and opinions about Israel in the United States continue to possess vital significance for the Jewish state. In the short term, the most important set of opinions issue from the White House and, to a lesser extent, Congress; Israel can glean these from first-hand observation and shape them through diplomatic exchange. In the long term, the American people s perceptions and judgments will prove decisive. The Jewish state s best bet for influencing these consists in serving as a strong and reliable American partner and providing an inspiring example of freedom and democracy. In the intermediate term, Israel has a keen interest in anticipating and planning for the next president s foreign policy. But whom will U.S. voters choose in November and what understanding of America and the world will prevail? The July/August issue of Foreign Affairs provides overviews of two main possibilities. Ben Rhodes, former deputy national security adviser for strategic communications during all eight years of Barack Obama s presidency, represents the Democrats. Rhodes urges the United States to minimize enormous risks and pursue new opportunities by adopting an updated conception of U.S. leadership one tailored to a world that has moved on from American primacy and the eccentricities of American politics. Making the case for Republicans is Robert O Brien, who served from 2019-2021 as national security adviser to President Donald Trump. Invoking presidents Washington, Roosevelt, Reagan, as well as Trump, O Brien argues for peace through strength. Rhodes and O Brien s conflicting views on Israel and the Middle East give a good sense of their slogans practical meanings and how their parties are disposed to conduct U.S. diplomacy. In A Foreign Policy for the World as It Is, Rhodes sides with many progressive critics of U.S. foreign policy who favor abandoning a mindset of American primacy. He joins the hard left at home and abroad in condemning not only Israel s exercise of its right to self-defense but also America s support of it. Indeed, after Hamas s October 7 attack on Israel and the Israeli military campaign in Gaza, American rhetoric about the rules-based international order has been seen around the world on a split screen of hypocrisy, as Washington has supplied the Israeli government with weapons used to bombard Palestinian civilians with impunity, writes Rhodes. The war has created a policy challenge for an administration that criticizes Russia for the same indiscriminate tactics that Israel has used in Gaza, a political challenge for a Democratic Party with core constituencies who don t understand why the president has supported a far-right government that ignores the United States advice, and a moral crisis for a country whose foreign policy purports to be driven by universal values. Rhodes swallows whole the odious canard that Israel s military operates lawlessly. He fails, however, to provide the slightest evidence that the Jewish state could accomplish its legitimate war aims with substantially less force. At the same time, Rhodes ignores Hamas grotesque violations of the international laws of war slaughtering, raping, mutilating, and kidnapping civilians while hiding behind, among, and under its own civilian population and the centrality of these reprehensible tactics to the jihadists ambitions to eradicate Israel. Like campus protesters throughout America, Rhodes deplores U.S. failure to thwart Israel s military operations in Gaza. Put simply, he maintains, Gaza should shock Washington out of the muscle memory that guides too many of its actions. Rhodes rebuke of U.S. Middle East policy goes well beyond Gaza. President Trump s signal Middle East achievements, argues Rhodes, undermined peace. By moving the U.S. embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, recognizing the annexation of the Golan Heights, and pursuing the Abraham Accords, according to Rhodes, Trump cut the Palestinians out of Arab-Israeli normalization and emboldened Israel s far right, lighting a fuse that detonated in the current war. Rhodes overlooks the Palestinians resolute opposition to U.S.-brokered peace initiatives by four presidents: Clinton, Bush, Obama, and Trump. He also fails to see that whereas Palestinian intransigence has produced an impasse, the Trump administration s bold steps, welcomed by Israel and Gulf Arabs, enhanced regional stability and provided new opportunities to ease the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. In sharp contrast to Rhodes, in The Return of Peace Through Strength, O Brien recognizes Israel as a close American friend and partner, affirms Jerusalem s legitimate war aims, and identifies the Islamic Republic of Iran as the principle threat to regional stability. Accordingly, the United States should continue to back Israel as it seeks to eliminate Hamas in Gaza, argues O Brien. Moreover, the long-term governance and status of the territory are not for Washington to dictate; the United States should support Israel, Egypt, and U.S. allies in the Gulf as they grapple with that problem, he writes. But Washington should not pressure Israel to return to negotiations over a long-term solution to the broader conflict with the Palestinians. Instead, the focus of U.S. policy in the Middle East should remain the malevolent actor that is ultimately most responsible for the turmoil and killing: the Iranian regime. Iran, O Brien emphasizes, has grown stronger and more belligerent under the Biden administration. The current White House has enabled Tehran to increase oil revenues by tens of billions of dollars over the last three and a half years. During the Biden administration, Tehran has managed to reach a point where it can not only produce nuclear weapons on-demand but produce large quantities of WGU [weapons-grade uranium] quickly in a very hard-to-destroy enrichment plant, reports the Institute for Science and International Security. And the Biden administration encouraged Tehran s diplomatic rehabilitation. Furthermore, observes O Brien, Iran s proxies, including Hamas, kidnap and kill Americans. And in April, for the first time, Iran attacked Washington s closest ally in the Middle East, Israel, directly from Iranian territory, firing hundreds of drones and missiles. Diminishing Iran s ability to export jihadist terror would also lead to a more productive approach to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, which is once again roiling the region, maintains O Brien. For decades, the conventional wisdom held that resolving that dispute was the key to improving security in the Middle East. But the conflict has become more of a symptom than a cause of tumult in the region, the true source of which is Iran s revolutionary, theocratic regime. Tehran provides critical funding, arms, intelligence, and strategic guidance to an array of groups that threaten Israel s security. Although preoccupied with the grind of daily battle with barbarous jihadists, Israelis have cause to follow carefully events transpiring in the United States and to prepare for their far-reaching repercussions. Whether the next American president renounces U.S. primacy in world affairs or returns to the pursuit of peace through strength is a choice that will have weighty consequences for the Jewish state and for America s interests in Middle East stability and global order.",

        "text": "Donald Trump is significantly more likely to win the 2024 presidential election after an apparent attempt to assassinate him on Saturday left him injured, according to a leading bookmaker.A gunman opened fire on a Trump rally near Butler, in Pennsylvania, on Saturday, killing one attendee and leaving two others seriously wounded, according to a Secret Service spokesperson.Broadcast footage from the event showed Trump was struck on his right ear, leaving it bleeding, before he was surrounded by Secret Service agents and led from the stage after defiantly raising his hand in a clenched fist. The suspected attacker, who the FBI identified as 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks, was shot and killed by return fire.On Saturday, prior to the assassination attempt, Trump's odds of winning the 2024 presidential election were 8/15 (65.2 percent) according to William Hill, a U.K. based betting company. However, after the shooting, this was slashed to a 4/11 (73.3 percent) chance of Trump achieving victory.Newsweek contacted representatives of the 2024 Trump and President Joe Biden's campaigns for comment on Sunday via email outside of usual office hours.Reacting to the shooting on his Truth Social website, Trump offered his condolences to the family of the person killed, adding: \"It is incredible that such an act can take place in our country. Nothing is known at this time about the shooter, who is now dead. I was shot with a bullet that pierced the upper part of my right ear.\"I knew immediately that something was wrong in that I heard a whizzing sound, shots, and immediately felt the bullet ripping through the skin. Much bleeding took place, so I realized then what was happening. GOD BLESS AMERICA!\"Biden condemned the attack in a post on X, formerly Twitter, writing: \"I have been briefed on the shooting at Donald Trump's rally in Pennsylvania.\"I'm grateful to hear that he's safe and doing well. I'm praying for him and his family and for all those who were at the rally, as we await further information.\"Jill and I are grateful to the Secret Service for getting him to safety. There's no place for this kind of violence in America. We must unite as one nation to condemn it.\"According to The Guardian, Crooks, who authorities are treating as the \"subject involved\" in the shooting, is a registered Republican voter in Pennsylvania, but in 2021 donated $15 to a left-leaning political action committee.In the immediate aftermath of Saturday's shooting Elon Musk, the Tesla CEO and X owner, endorsed Trump, later adding: \"Last time America had a candidate this tough was Theodore Roosevelt.\"Speaking to the BBC, Greg Smith, a Trump supporter who was outside the rally, said he saw a man with a rifle crawling along a rooftop prior to the shooting and attempted to alert the authorities.He said: \"We noticed the guy bear-crawling up the roof of the building beside us, 50 feet away from us. He had a rifle; we could clearly see a rifle.\"We're pointing at him, the police are down there running around on the ground, we're like, 'Hey man, there's a guy on the roof with a rifle'... and the police did not know what was going on.\"",
