        "text": "World leaders united Saturday to condemn the attempt on ex-President Trump\u2019s life during a rally in Pennsylvania. Argentina\u2019s president Javier Milei threw his full support behind Trump, who he called the \u201cvictim of a COWARDLY assassination attempt.\u201d Milei also claimed that the shooting was part of a leftist agenda to keep Trump from securing another presidential term. \u201cThe desperation of the international left is not surprising, as today it sees its harmful ideology expire, and is willing to destabilize democracies and promote violence to screw itself into power,\u201d he wrote on X. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who had a rocky relationship with Trump, slammed the attack as \u201cpolitical violence.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m sickened by the shooting at former President Trump. It cannot be overstated \u2014 political violence is never acceptable. My thoughts are with former President Trump, those at the event, and all Americans,\u201d said Trudeau, who has had a rocky relationship with Trump, said on X. Sympathy for Trump also poured in from the US\u2019s southern border, with Mexican President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador calling the attack \u201cirrational and inhuman.\u201d Israel\u2019s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu \u2014 who once described Trump as \u201cthe greatest friend that Israel has ever had in the White House\u201d \u2014 said he and his wife were \u201cshocked by the apparent attack.\u201d \u201cWe pray for his safety and speedy recovery,\u201d Netanyahu said on X. Trump was hit in the ear by a bullet in the midst of giving remarks at a campaign stop in Butler. He was seen raising his hand to his right ear as nearly ten rounds of gunfire erupted before he was tackled to the ground by Secret Service agents. Other members of the service\u2019s counter-terrorism unit \u201cneutralized\u201d the would-be assassin, killing them, insiders told The Post. Sources said Trump came within \u201cinches of his life.\u201d American political leaders from both sides of the aisle \u2014 including those who butted heads with Trump in the past \u2014 expressed their disgust in the wake of the shooting. Michael Cohen, a one-time fixer for Trump who helped prosecutors secure the first-ever presidential conviction, criticized the extreme violence that left one audience member dead and another seriously injured. Follow The Post\u2019s latest stories on the assassination attempt against former President Donald Trump: Trump says he \u2018felt the bullet ripping through my skin\u2019 in first statement since assassination attempt Former President Trump \u2018inches away from having his face shot open\u2019 by assassin\u2019s bullet during Pa. rally; sniper killed: sources Gunman behind attempted assassination on Trump had head blown off by Secret Service, sources say; rally-goer killed Witnesses frantically tried to warn police of rifle-carrying sniper on roof before Trump assassination attempt Trump sees outpouring of support after assassination attempt at rally stop Keep up to date on updates with the Post\u2019s live blog on the assassination attempt on Trump \u201cWhether you agree or disagree with someone\u2019s political position, THIS IS NOT THE SOLUTION!\u201d Cohen, a star witness in the Stormy Daniels hush money trial, told The Post. Trump pollster John McLaughlin compared the near-miss to the March 30, 1981 assassination attempt on then-President Ronald Reagan. \u201cIt was a bad flashback,\u201d McLaughlin, who was a 25-year-old Reagan backer then, told The Post. \u201cYou can\u2019t take anything for granted,\u201d the pollster said. Like Reagan, Trump offered a signal to the audience that he had survived the initial assault. The bleeding 2024 presidential hopeful raised a fist to a cheering crowd before he was pushed into an SUV. \u201cReagan was shot. He survived and did well. He won re-election in a landslide,\u201d McLaughlin continued. \u201cWe pray that the boss is good and we go on from here.\u201d Dozens of Democrats \u2014 particularly those who have been outspoken against Trump in the past \u2014 offered their condolences for the injured politician Saturday. Former President Barack Obama, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries were among those who condemned the attack, the latter of who described the shooting as \u201cpolitical violence.\u201d",

The posts, including some written by U.S. politicians holding elected office, claimed without proof that President Joe Biden had ordered an apparent shooting at the rally. Others baselessly stated that the incident was staged, or circulated posts misidentifying the shooter. In the aftermath of major news, the facts of an event are not always immediately clear. Law enforcement, including the Secret Service, the FBI, Pennsylvania state police and the Justice Department have said they are continuing to investigate the shooting, including the possibility it was an assassination attempt.

On X, several politicians accused Biden or his campaign of being \u201cdirectly\u201d behind the apparent shooting, without providing evidence. Georgia Rep.

Vance, a top contender for Trump\u2019s vice-presidential running mate, wrote on X that the Biden campaign\u2019s rhetoric \u201cled directly to President Trump\u2019s attempted assassination.\u201d Texas Rep. Ronny Jackson pointed to unnamed figures on the left whom he accused of being \u201cdirectly responsible\u201d for the events at Trump\u2019s campaign rally. Collins, Vance and Jackson did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Their posts on X altogether garnered more than 7.3 million views on Saturday evening, according to data from the social media platform. As of late Saturday evening, the shooter\u2019s name had not been released to the public though NBC News said authorities have tentatively identified the man as approximately 20 years old and from Pennsylvania. Earlier posts on X, Telegram and Gab, forums favored by many on the far-right, misidentified the shooter as a man called Mark Violets, calling him a \u201cknown Antifa extremist\u201d that refers to the loosely organized leftist movement. According to NBC News, the misidentified person circulated in posts that included a photo was Marco Violi, an Italian YouTuber who has denied any involvement in the shooting. Immediately after the shooting, hundreds of thousands of posts reaching millions of views circulated on X claiming the shooting at the Pennsylvania rally was \u201cstaged,\u201d according to data from the social media platform \u2014 without offering any evidence. Despite being quickly debunked, many of the posts remained live on the platform. In the past year, content moderation efforts on major social media platforms have been weakened, as social media analysis tools have been shelved by Meta Platforms Inc. and others, and efforts from academic teams tracking misinformation, such as the Stanford Internet Observatory, have wound down.

        "text": "CAROLINA, Puerto Rico (AP) \u2014 Vianca Bra\u00f1a never used to attend basketball games in her hometown of Carolina, Puerto Rico \u2014 or anywhere else in the United States territory. But in recent years, the 23-year-old has left the arena with a hoarse voice, often wearing a T-shirt that reads \u201cCarola,\u201d a nickname for her town. \u201cWe started making this fun, and I wanted to represent the town where I\u2019m from,\u201d said Bra\u00f1a, who attended her first game the year Puerto Rican reggaeton star Bad Bunny bought a team in the island\u2019s professional men\u2019s basketball league. It was also around that time that she began placing bets on different teams across Puerto Rico with her girlfriends. Bra\u00f1a\u2019s fervor illustrates how Puerto Rico\u2019s professional men\u2019s basketball league is experiencing a revival, driven by reggaeton stars like Bad Bunny, Ozuna and Anuel AA, who are stepping into the financial game, buying local teams and helping to stack up a loyal fan base the island hasn\u2019t witnessed in over 40 years. What were once half-empty arenas in Puerto Rico are now packed, filled with families and young fans cheering for their favorite teams, from Los Capitanes de Arecibo in northern Puerto Rico to Los Leones de Ponce in the south. Attendance more than doubled from 2018 to 2023, skyrocketing from some 480,000 tickets sold to nearly 1 million, according to Puerto Rico\u2019s professional men\u2019s basketball league, whose digital presence has also soared in the past few years. A pivotal moment in the league\u2019s revival came in 2021, when three-time Grammy winner Bad Bunny became co-owner of Los Cangrejeros de Santurce, along with his manager, Noah Assad. Bad Bunny\u2019s frequent game-day visits sparked a resurgence in Puerto Rico\u2019s basketball scene. Other artists like Anuel AA quickly followed, buying Arecibo\u2019s Capitanes team before a new owner took over in 2023, and Ozuna acquiring Manat\u00ed\u2019s team, renaming it Los Osos, in 2022. The league, known as BSN, currently has 12 teams playing, compared with nine just four years ago. Basketball games have transformed into premier rendezvous events, attracting celebrities like NBA legend LeBron James, former boxer Floyd Mayweather and reggaeton artists including Arcangel and Rauw Alejandro, capturing audiences of all ages hoping to get a glimpse of them. \u201cWhen Noah and Bad Bunny came along, we generated a lot of noise,\u201d said Ricardo Dalmau, president of BSN. \u201cIt was an explosion of attention.\u201d Dalmau said local TV ratings also saw an upward tick after they began broadcasting some games in 2021, with the biggest surprise being their largest viewership block: women ages 18 to 49, a new audience that was also reflected in the bleachers. \u201cYou never know what artist you\u2019re going to find in the (league),\u201d he said. Before its recent surge in popularity, the league was under financial strain. Although Dalmau did not provide specific numbers, he said there used to be a lot of uncertainty about whether certain teams would participate or whether the league could fulfill players\u2019 contracts. \u201cWe don\u2019t have those problems anymore,\u201d he said. Javier Sabath, a popular basketball commentator on the island, said he is witnessing what his father \u2014 a sports commentator himself decades ago \u2014 describes as the environment in the 1980s, the heyday of the league. \u201cNew generations have never seen this before,\u201d Sabath said. \u201cThe boom with urban artists revived the Puerto Rican sports history that had been forgotten.\u201d Sabath said the momentum created by artists has fueled fans\u2019 excitement beyond just seeing reggaeton stars. \u201cIndirectly, these artists are attracting enough attention to make people interested in our league,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a domino effect.\u201d A bittersweet moment took place recently, when Puerto Rico national men\u2019s basketball team, composed of several of the league\u2019s star players, qualified for the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris. The victory over Lithuania broke a 20-year drought for the team that last competed in 2004, beating the USA team in the Athens Olympics. It is also a loss for the league\u2019s teams playing later in the summer. The league\u2019s renaissance comes after its peak over 40 years ago. Teams in Bayam\u00f3n, Quebradillas, Ponce and other towns had produced renowned players, including Butch Lee, the first Puerto Rican player to enter the National Basketball Association; Raymond Dalmau, whose son currently presides over the league; and Rub\u00e9n Rodr\u00edguez, who played for Los Vaqueros in Bayam\u00f3n. As part of the current frenzy, ex-NBA players have moved to Puerto Rico in recent years to join the league. Will Barton and Jared Sullinger play for San Juan\u2019s team, while other ex-NBA players like DeMarcus Cousins, Lance Stephenson and Brandon Knight also joined before moving on to other stints. Still, some problems remain beyond the league\u2019s control, including severe budget cuts, with the government slashing the island\u2019s sports and recreation department budget by more than half over the past decade. A lack of investment and maintenance in sports arenas across the island has caused leaks, leading to game suspensions after heavy rains. \u201cDespite the lack of economic resources, we\u2019ve been able to sort it out,\u201d said Ray Qui\u00f1ones, secretary of sports and recreation of Puerto Rico, whose infrastructure budget was cut from about $15,300 in 2014 to barely $7,500 in 2024. Sports arenas face the additional problem of chronic power outages across Puerto Rico, which is still rebuilding its electric grid after Hurricane Mar\u00eda, a Category 4 storm that razed the island in September 2017. In June, a game in Carolina between the home team, Los Gigantes, and Los Indios of Mayag\u00fcez was suspended after a widespread power outage left more than 340,000 customers without electricity. A month earlier, a game in San Juan\u2019s main arena was also suspended due to a power outage. Despite the challenges, younger generations are finding refuge outside their homes \u2014 which also contend with frequent power outages \u2014 and a new sense of pride by attending the games. For fans like Annais Ram\u00edrez, basketball arenas feel like safe spaces, especially for women looking to engage in historically male-dominated areas. \u201cThere are so many artists coming to the games, and you wonder if you\u2019ll run into one,\u201d the 27-year-old said as she stood next to her friend, who sported a necklace with a diamond-encrusted \u201cC\u201d for the town of Carolina. Her love for Carolina\u2019s team has grown beyond her expectation to run into a celebrity. During her free time, Ram\u00edrez goes on social media to catch up on the games she couldn\u2019t attend in person, checking out highlights, halftime performances and crowd reactions. \u201cThose motivate you to be part of the movement,\u201d she said. \u201cOn weekdays, this helps me unwind.\u201d ___ Follow AP\u2019s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america",

[+] during the UFC Fight Night event at Ball Arena on July 13, 2024 in Denver, Colorado. (Photo by Josh Hedges/Zuffa LLC via Getty Images) Zuffa LLC via Getty Images Rose Namajunas got the job done in the main event of UFC Denver on Saturday night at the Ball Arena. With Saturday's unanimous-decision win over Tracy Cortez, the former two-time strawweight champion has won two in a row at flyweight. Despite her strong performance and a display of her well-rounded game in the win, the future Hall-of-Famer, Rose Namajunas, was not among the bonus winners. Here is a list of the results from Saturday, July 13, in Denver, and the bonus winners from a night with a ton of finishes. Rose Namajunas defeats Tracy Cortez by unanimous decision (49-46, 49-46, 48-47) Muslim Salikhov defeats Santiago Ponzinibbio by split decision (28-29, 29-28, 29-28) Jean Silva defeats Drew Dober by TKO (doctor\u2019s stoppage) at 1:28 of Round 3 - FOTN Gabriel Bonfim defeats Ange Loosa by unanimous decision (30-27, 30-27, 29-28) Julian Erosa defeats Christian Rodriguez by submission (guillotine choke) at 4:49 of Round 1 Abdul Razak Alhassan and Cody Brundage ruled a No Contest (accidental blows) at 0:37 of Round 1 Charles Johnson defeats Joshua Van by knockout (right uppercut) at 0:20 of Round 3 - POTN Jasmine Jasudavicus defeats Fatima Kline by unanimous decision (30-27, 30-27, 30-27) Montel Jackson defeats Da\u2019Mon Blackshear by knockout (left hand) at 0:18 of Round 1 - POTN Luana Santos defeats Mariya Agapova by submission (rear-naked choke) at 3:27 of Round 1 Andre Petroski defeats Josh Fremd by unanimous decision (30-27, 30-27, 30-27) Evan Elder defeats Darrius Flowers by submission (arm-triangle choke) at 1:46 of Round 2 Forbes VettedFor You The Best Gaming Laptops Under $1,000: Boost Your Games For Less By Jon Martindale Contributor Bonus Winners DENVER, COLORADO - JULY 13: (L-R) Jean Silva of Brazil punches in a lightweight fight during the ... [+] UFC Fight Night event at Ball Arena on July 13, 2024 in Denver, Colorado. (Photo by Josh Hedges/Zuffa LLC via Getty Images) Zuffa LLC via Getty Images The UFC got it right with every $50,000 bonus they awarded in Denver. Dober and Silva put on the most spirited scrap of the evening on the main card. Silva\u2019s striking power and his chin were on full display. He opened a nasty gash over Dober\u2019s right eye with a spinning back elbow in the first round. The cut was worsened by the same strike in the third, which led to the Octagonside doctor calling an end to the Fight. It was a great fight and well worth the Fight of the Night bonus it received. Montel Jackson\u2019s power is pretty amazing. He scored the second-fastest finish in men\u2019s bantamweight history with his 18-second destruction of Da\u2019Mon Blackshear on the prelims. Take a look at this and take note of Dominick Cruz\u2019s timely call of the finish and the strike type. It was only 18 seconds of work, but well worth a bonus. Jackson has won five fights in a row and might be ranked in the Top 15 in the UFC\u2019s next update. Charles Johnson got the other bonus of the night for his third-round KO win over Joshua Van. Johnson increased his aggression in the third round in a close fight that he might have been losing on the scorecards. He landed a right cross that hurt Van, and Johnson followed it up with an uppercut from long range that led to the finish. Here is a look at Johnson\u2019s finish: Johnson is on a run, having won his last three contests. It was a strong night of fights in Denver as the UFC heads back to the Apex in Las Vegas for Saturday\u2019s card, a much smaller event with Amanda Lemos and Virna Jandiroba headlining.

        "text": "Sonic The Hedgehog is a beloved figure, lending his name to an abundance of games in the Sonic franchise, including crossover games such as Super Smash Bros. and Mario and Sonic. As such, it is no surprise that he has found his way into the realm of horror. Since the creepypasta \"SONIC.EXE\" was posted in 2011 by JC-the-Hyena \u2014 revolving around a cursed Sonic game in which Sonic is some kind of evil entity \u2014 Sonic horror games have steadily increased in popularity. Despite still being a relatively niche corner of the gaming world, many platforms are saturated with Sonic and Sonic.exe fan-games, and it can be difficult to distinguish which ones are trustworthy or even worth playing. The following are among the highest rated Sonic horror games that can be found on itch.io. 7 Sonic Shock Itch.io Score: 3 Developer: Haunted Bees Productions Sonic Shock is a role-playing horror-adventure game. Waking at \"Space Colony M0B1\" after being cryogenically frozen, the player must find mayhem rubies to find and defeat \"Doctor Roboton,\" who has turned everyone into robots. Quite unlike the games in the Sonic franchise, this one takes certain elements and remodels them into something entirely new. Considering it is made entirely from stock photos, Sonic Shock has a surprisingly retro feel and its own unique atmosphere. With shooter and stealth mechanics, and the option to upgrade abilities, this game is great for all kinds of gamers \u2014 not just horror fans. 6 Felix And Friends Itch.io Score: 4 Developer: Wrath of Wood In Felix and Friends, the player takes on the role of Felix the Cat, another familiar character from the cartoon world. After his home is broken into by \"The Copywriters,\" who have sent other famous figures after him for breaking copyright law, he flees. While not overtly gory or jump-scary, the familiar yet different character and environment designs are extremely uncanny. Traversing different levels of a Sonic-inspired platform world, players will come across a range of bosses, each modeled after familiar game and TV characters. After defeating these bosses (\"Soniku\" being the first they come across), the player can play as them. Overall, Felix and Friends is both comical and very self-aware, offering a well put-together experience that comments on the fan-game industry. 5 Sonic's School Day Itch.io Score: 4 Developer: MrScottyPieey Sonic's School Day is a first-person survival horror game. Harking back to the original SEGA educational game, Sonic's Schoolhouse, the player must navigate a maze of classrooms and hallways and escape a variety of different characters. With surreal environments, multiplayer mode, and math and spelling elements, this game is extremely unsettling. Players will never know what to expect when they turn a corner. Sonic's School Day also supports mods for gamers who enjoy customizing their games. 4 Sonic 1 Prototype Itch.io Score: 4 Developer: MosaicArts Sonic 1 Prototype begins relatively normally in the Green Hill Zone of the original Sonic the Hedgehog (1991). With familiar loops and ring collection, this game could be mistaken for any other Sonic game. However, there are some hints that all is not as it seems. As the player progresses through the acts, they may notice dead animals scattered about the landscape. During Act 3, the sky turns black, and the landscape becomes obscured by a static hue. Once the error pops up and the player is told to \"Leave Now,\" they can heed the warning or continue \u2014 at their own risk. 3 Executable Education Itch.io Score: 4.2 Developer: Shroudy Software Executable Education is a first-person horror game with three different levels. First, the player must find functional computers in their office to type words and remove the sonic.exe virus, while being stalked by a disturbingly dark version of Sonic. Once completed, they clip to a school where they must complete math tasks as a ruler-wielding Sonic hunts them down. Finally, they must monitor and fend off hostile Sonic robots via security cameras. Overall, Executable Education has diverse gameplay that draws on other familiar mechanics and environments while maintaining its own unique and horrific universe. 2 Five Nights At Sonic's Reimagined Itch.io Score: 5 Developer: Sanic As its title suggests, Five Nights at Sonic's Reimagined is a Sonic and Five Night's at Freddy's-inspired crossover. Taking on the night shift at SEGA Inc., the player must survive for five nights from 12am to 6am. It is not that simple, however, as the malfunctioning character performers that had been scrapped and locked away have now escaped. Five Nights at Sonic's Reimagined maintains a lot of the tension that the best Five Nights at Freddy's games are known for, but at the same time, this game deviates to take on its own aesthetic and lore. With a bonus 6th night, unlockable extras, and a custom nights mode, Five Nights at Sonic's Reimagined is both entertaining and immersive. 1 Another Sonic.exe Fan Game (2.0) Itch.io Score: 5 Developer: Pudim Abestado An upgraded sequel to the developer's previous game of the same name, Another Sonic.exe Fan Game (2.0) is worth checking out. Each playable character (Tails, Knuckles, and Doctor Robotnik) has their own level, with different objectives tailored to their lore in the original game series. Similarly, the characters have their own abilities that can help with the tasks; Tails can fly, Knuckles can punch, etc. They must complete the objectives in time or face the wrath of Sonic, who has his own evil agenda. This game is both challenging and fun, and it has a very dark atmosphere. It also has multiple endings, depending on the outcome of the different levels.",

        "text": "HoYoverse, mainly known as MiHoYo, have been developing games for otakus for more than a decade. In their journey of 10+ years they have released a variety of games. While the core theme of the games remains the same, revolving around cute female characters as the playable avatars, each game is vastly different from each other in many ways. MiHoYo has more than half a dozen games under their belt, and while most of these games do not belong in the same genre, a question arises nonetheless: Which game is the best? This list answers that question by ranking all the games by MiHoYo from worst to best. 9 Legend Of Saha The Beginning Of The Journey Having Legend of Saha on this list at all is a stretch, but the game deserves a spot as an honorable mention, as it kicks off a thrilling adventure for the founders of MiHoYo, the tech otakus who save the world. The game was originally supposed to be a part of a bigger game, but a flash game was made with only one character by Cai Haoyu in 2010 for a student competition. The game won some prizes in the competition, which acted as a stepping stone for the eventual founding of MiHoYo. Despite being a simple game where players are tasked with moving from one level to another dodging enemy attacks, it's rich with story, presented in the form of walls of text. Legend of Saha lays the foundation for the games eventually created by MiHoYo, and there is a chance that the story of Misei Nanatsuki, the main character of Legend of Saha, could be reused in . 8 FlyMe2theMoon Introducing The Poster Child Of MiHoYo is the game where the character Kiana Kaslana was brought to life, who further served as the poster child for MiHoYo. This game revolves around controlling Kiana, equipped with a jetpack, as she has to navigate through obstacles to try and reach the moon. The game featured plenty of levels to play and came with a soundtrack made with VOCALOID software named MoonTrip. The name of the game was inspired from the ending theme of Neon Genesis Evangelion, which also served as the basis for the game\u2019s concept. This 2D side scrolling game features different modes, like adventure, puzzle, racing and exploration. It is moderately challenging, and it keeps players engaged over the course of 60 levels. With a nice art style and skill-based gameplay, even if the game is rough in the controls department, FlyMe2theMoon is a good game that can keep players entertained hours. 7 Zombiegal Kawaii / Houkai Gakuen Even The Zombies Are Too Adorable To Shoot Moving on from FlyMe2theMoon, miHoYo takes a leap when they create , also known as . This side-scrolling shooter takes the players on a zombie killing spree inspired by the anime manga series Highschool of the Dead. The shoot-em-up style gameplay paired with adorable art and cute voice work keeps the atmosphere of the game light. Players control Kiana once again, as she fights against large hordes of deadly yet adorable zombies. While at times upgrades become a necessity to make progress, and players can either use real money or grind for a few hours to steadily make progress, it doesn\u2019t hinder the overall enjoyability of the game. The entire vibe of is fun and lighthearted, and with its simple gameplay, Zombiegal Kawaii attracted plenty of gaming otakus towards miHoYo. 6 Guns GirlZ / Houkai Gakuen 2 A Step Up From Its Predecessor Soon after the first Houkai Gakuen was released, miHoyo worked hard and fast to release the second installment in the series. This is the first time the developers stuck with the same gameplay style as their previous game. takes over from its predecessor while telling a comprehensive story for the first time in any of miHoYo's games. The narrative expands on the simple setting of its predecessor, as it depicts girls surviving the zombie apocalypse due to a Houkai phenomenon that occurs once in several centuries. GGZ makes gameplay more interesting by adding more characters and weapons, which can be further upgraded using in-game resources. An additional multiplayer mode is also available for players to play with friends. GGZ also introduces a Guild system, where multiple players can join a guild to access more opportunities for events and rewards. With a proper story that expands with frequent game updates, along with many other additional features, Gun GirlsZ turned out to be a financial success, forcing miHoYo to increase their team size if they wanted to grow further. 5 Tears Of Themis A Treat For Otome Fans miHoYo has always explored different genres when developing a new title. focused on a different side of otaku culture that was not yet explored by miHoyo. The game falls in the mystery romance genre, and almost plays itself via a visual novel format. With a self-insert character for players, the protagonist starts her journey as a rookie lawyer brimming with ambition and determined to help people. The story involves players solving various cases and getting involved with the four main potential love interests. The game has a variety of stuff to do, ranging from completing cases and progressing the story to collecting characters from the Gacha system and completing time-limited events to collect rewards. Tears of Themis takes ideas from other otome games and puts its own spin on them, thus creating something new while honoring the familiar elements of the genre. While the gameplay might not be everyone's cup of tea, Tears of Themis will be loved by otome fans and players looking for mysterious stories, compelling art, and bold romances. 4 Zenless Zone Zero The Latest Entry From HoYoverse Zenless Zone Zero is the latest HoYoverse endeavor in their grand journey of making games for the otakus. Pivoting from the fantasy setting of Genshin Impact and the space adventures of Honkai Star Rail, HoYoverse moves to make Zenless Zone Zero a game set in an urban dystopia. This action RPG is by far Hoyoverse\u2019s best work when it comes to fluid character animations and physics. Utilizing various characters in combat, parrying enemy attacks at the right time to trigger intro skills and performing various combos to defeat the enemies forms the core gameplay of ZZZ. Zenless Zone Zero has more style and esthetic excellence than any HoYoverse game. Instead of featuring a vast open world with a grand story where the players are up against the gods, the game takes a more grounded approach, as players experience the story of two tech enthusiast siblings and their day-to-day adventures in a retro dystopia. 3 Honkai Impact 3 The Game That Established miHoYo miHoYo have dabbled with a variety of projects since their formation, but it was with when they found immense success. HI3 represents the evolution of miHoYo from a niche Gacha game development company to one of the biggest powerhouses in the Gacha market. Taking a big gamble when developing the game, miHoYo\u2019s plan for their next game was a 3D action RPG Gacha, and with constant support for the game, they have righteously taken HI3 to another level. There are a ton of reasons to explain the popularity of the game back when it was released in 2016. From smooth animations and fluid gameplay to the adorable playable characters, Honkai Impact 3rd is a treat for the otakus. However, as that strong gameplay evolved with time, miHoYo also successfully created a compelling story with unique characters to keep players invested and, while the game is witnessing an end to its 7-year-long saga, it is still going strong with new content, characters, and gameplay to attract fans even after almost a decade. 2 Genshin Impact Making Gacha Games More Mainstream made waves in the gaming space when it was launched in 2020. The open world RPG appealed to a vast audience, and acted as a gateway for players who were strangers to Gacha games. miHoYo has always been focusing on new things and, with Genshin Impact, their newfound focus was on creating a breathtaking open world full of diversity came to life when they created the beautiful world of Teyvat. The boundless world of Teyvat is divided into 7 unique nations, and each part of Teyvat offers a plethora of activities for players to take on. From exploring the beautiful world of the game to fighting monsters and bosses, collecting loot and new characters, and then upgrading them for use in combat, there is no end in sight in terms of content offered. The combat in the game is also unique, as it creates its own elemental reaction system, and players have to use a mixture of various elements in battle efficiently and string together some serious combos. By creating a game that appeals to casual players who like to explore the world and immerse themselves in the lore of a game, and to the hardcore ones who like to build teams and characters to fight enemies as effectively as possible, this Breath of the Wild-inspired game is something special, making it one of the best HoYoverse games ever made. 1 Honkai: Star Rail Going On A Majestic Interstellar Journey After spending many years creating action RPGs, miHoYo moved on to try something different, and began the creation of . This turn-based RPG is by far miHoYo\u2019s best game, as it learns from the mistakes of the previous games and creates something engaging and entertaining. miHoYo always had a reputation for creating intricate stories, and Honkai: Star Rail lives up to their reputation. Playing as an amnesiac protagonist, the players embark on a space odyssey, visiting different planets, meeting new characters, and unraveling the mystery behind their origins. The gameplay takes the Gacha elements of the game into consideration, and creates a style that is suited to both possible scenarios: Manual battles where players have to carefully strategize, and an auto-battle option to grind stages quickly and effectively to level characters up. Apart from this, the game features a big area to explore while playing the story, filled with surprises to discover. The worlds in Star Rail are lively, and players can interact with everything, even random objects, which is an amusing little detail. Fun interactions, quirky dialogue, and pop culture references are commonly found in Star Rail, and they balance well with the darker themes of the game, like loss, injustice, and suffering. Paying attention to little details and learning from past mistakes, HoYoverse has created its best RPG yet. Star Rail offers dozens of hours of gameplay to keep players engaged, and with more content to come, that will only increase. It also features extremely player-friendly support for a Gacha game, which makes Honkai: Star Rail by far the best game created by miHoYo.",

        "text": "It\u2019s a beautiful day in Essex and I\u2019m making myself at home with the Dyers. Theirs is a neat house on a hill, furnished in white and grey with a vast marble kitchen island and a bulldog called Debbie. And, no offence, but my God Debbie is large. The width and girth of a coffee table, she lumbers affectionately across the tiles towards Jo, Dyer\u2019s partner of more than 30 years, elegant in white as she mourns a missing T-shirt, and their teenage daughter Sunnie, who sweeps through to grab a bottle of water on her way to college. Artie, who\u2019s 10, is at school and their eldest daughter, Dani, is in Germany with her three children, aged three and under, there to support her footballer boyfriend Jarrod Bowen at the Euros. Builders sweat on the patio outside, the sun glints off shelves of awards. And there, in the middle of it all, grinning into a tiny coffee, is Dyer, calling everyone baby. Dyer, Debbie and I stand in the awards alcove and with his pointing finger he takes me on a swift tour of his career. \u201cI\u2019ve nicked a few awards over the years I suppose,\u201d he smiles. \u201cI did really well, I can\u2019t believe that.\u201d There are National Television Awards won over his nine years on EastEnders, one of which he dedicated, in a choked acceptance speech, to his mentor Harold Pinter and children living in poverty, then there\u2019s a framed photo of Pinter and an Attitude award he won for being a \u201cstraight ally\u201d for his first soap storyline. He\u2019s proud of that one. \u201cI remember when they approached me about EastEnders and I thought, obviously I\u2019m going to be coming in as a gangster or something like that. Alpha male, working class, anti-gay.\u201d Then they said his first storyline would involve his son coming out to him. \u201cThey created this character for me who was an alpha male, but who wore a pink dressing gown. Somebody that is very protective, can swing a right hander, but will open up about his feelings.\u201d The dog gives me a pointed look, as if to check I can tell he\u2019s talking about himself. to be the year of Danny Dyer. As well as his TV comedy debut, in Ryan Sampson\u2019s Mr Bigstuff on Sky, he\u2019s starring in Disney\u2019s glossy new adaptation of Jilly Cooper\u2019s Rivals (\u201cWait until you see Danny,\u201d co-star David Tennant said, \u201cHe\u2019s brilliant.\u201d) and a film about football hooliganism called Marching Powder. Today he\u2019s wearing a large gold watch that glitters as he sips his coffee \u2013 in front of him now on the impossibly tidy kitchen counter are a baby\u2019s dummy and white dice, into which I idly read some light symbolism. His family have left the room and he marvels briefly. \u201cMe and Jo have been together since we were 13. Which just doesn\u2019t happen, does it, now? It\u2019s fascinating to me, still. When I look at her, part of me sees her back then, but then I also look at the pair of us and go, \u2018Wow, we\u2019re grandparents now.\u2019 It\u2019s been a mad old journey.\u201d They grew up on the same council estate in east London, where, when Dyer was nine years old, his father left them for his other, secret family. Dyer\u2019s reaction was rage; he was in constant trouble until his drama teacher enrolled him in a Saturday club where he was spotted by an agent and, at 16, cast in Prime Suspect. He and Jo had Dani two years later. \u201cI remember on Twitter someone said, \u2018The most Danny Dyer thing Danny Dyer\u2019s ever done is calling his kid Dani Dyer,\u2019\u201d Dyer says, wrinkling his nose, \u201cAnd I thought, \u2018What the fuck does that even mean?\u2019\u201d It\u2019s just what you do, he mumbles; you name your kid after yourself. He laughs. When she won Love Island in 2018, \u201cAll of a sudden, I was the second most famous Danny Dyer in the country.\u201d Why did he roll his eyes at the idea of EastEnders casting him as a gangster? \u201cI think I\u2019m falling into the category where people either respect me as an actor or they think that I play myself. So that\u2019s been a running theme throughout my life.\u201d He muses for a second. \u201cThere\u2019s an element of classism in it, because I speak in a cockney accent. But I think my mistake was that I\u2019ve probably done too many documentaries [like Danny Dyer\u2019s Deadliest Men, or I Believe in UFOs] and revealed too much about myself as a human being. Because as actors our toolbox is us. If you give away all your stuff, then people watch you and go, \u2018Oh he\u2019s just playing himself.\u2019 But that\u2019s what acting is. We\u2019re salespeople. Do you believe it? Do you buy it? Do you give a fuck about what I\u2019m talking about? It\u2019s not about whether you can do hundreds of accents. In my eyes, it\u2019s like, do you believe what I\u2019m saying? Do you care? And so you have to dig within.\u201d On the other hand, it\u2019s been these documentaries that have brought him a lot of fans, and fame. \u201cI divide opinion, but I think that\u2019s fine. I struggled with it as a younger actor and when social media first came around. But I\u2019m absolutely fine with it now.\u201d The struggle, back then, was well documented in the tabloids. There were cheating scandals and drug scandals. One night in 2001 he was on stage in New York, in Pinter\u2019s Celebration, and he went blank. He was 24 and had stayed up all night smoking crack. Pinter \u201cbollocked\u201d him, but it took a few more years before Dyer took himself to rehab, slowly becoming the meditative family man he is today. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to try and squeeze as much fucking joy out of life as you possibly can,\u201d he goes on. \u201cBecause the one thing I learned when I was going through some crazy times is that your fucking brain is your worst enemy. It questions us all the time and we can\u2019t escape it.\u201d Every evening he takes 10 minutes to meditate, \u201cand just completely concentrate on my breath, and let all the fucking shit go, then have a good night\u2019s sleep and then attack the day again.\u201d In rehab he had therapy, where for the first time he started talking about his father. \u201cThere\u2019s little holes. You\u2019ve got stuff missing within your soul and you don\u2019t know why and you try and fill it with drugs or drink and it doesn\u2019t work. And so I learned from going to therapy that I had abandonment issues from men.\u201d After his father left, his beloved grandad died from cancer, \u201cand that sent me off the rails a little bit, but then that was around the time I met Pinter. I wasn\u2019t looking for a father figure, but he took me under his wing.\u201d When Pinter died in 2008, \u201cI pushed my \u2018fuck-it button\u2019. It was about destroying relationships before they could fuck me over. Which is why I sort of went a bit crazy.\u201d Therapy helped him understand himself, but, \u201cI think doing Who Do You Think You Are? helped me as well.\u201d This is the BBC genealogy show that, in 2016, aired its \u201cbest episode ever\u201d. Dyer had no idea, after they\u2019d investigated his family tree, what they were going to reveal. \u201cI knew there was an energy,\u201d he remembers. \u201cI thought it might have something to do with criminality. I was hoping for some sort of old-school Shakespearean actor, something that would make me go, \u2018Oh I\u2019ve got it in my blood.\u2019 Then, the way it panned out was fucking ridiculous.\u201d Dyer discovered he was a direct descendant of King Edward III; when he was told, sitting in the choir of Westminster Abbey, he looked as though he was going to faint. The relative he was more excited to discover, though, was Thomas Cromwell, his \u201c15 times great-grandfather. He was a working-class kid who rose through the ranks and was really clever and became a medieval righthand man, and he had no right! And so I thought, \u2018OK, I can see similarities in the sense that he had no right to be where he was either.\u2019\u201d He thinks for a second. \u201cAnd his downfall obviously was that he became almost too powerful and he didn\u2019t fit the mould. He didn\u2019t have any aristocrat parents to get him out of trouble. And his last act, his last roll of the dice\u2026\u201d he grins, surprised to find he is, in fact, holding some dice, \u201cwhich is why I\u2019m sitting here today, is that he got his son to marry Jane Seymour\u2019s sister. If he hadn\u2019t done that Gregory would have been killed as well.\u201d Then they had a child and their child had a child, \u201cand then I\u2019m 15 generations later. He was really famous and out of his depth slightly. So it made me go, \u2018My life makes sense to me now\u2019.\u201d doing the other documentaries? \u201cNo, not really, because I needed money to feed my children. I\u2019m just plying my trade as an actor, like a spark would, or a plumber.\u201d Twenty years ago he made a film called The Football Factory, \u201cwhich made me very famous, but I didn\u2019t get any money for it. So I was stuck in that weird room of being famous, but not having the money to back it up.\u201d Then the documentaries came along. \u201cI had no desire to run around the country speaking to hooligans, meeting them under dark tunnels with balaclavas on and all that. I wasn\u2019t on something journalistic, but it got me a house. That\u2019s the truth.\u201d At the time he was still living on the same council estate where he\u2019d grown up. \u201cI\u2019m very proud of where I\u2019m from. I\u2019m very proud of my roots. And I love the people who inhabit them spaces, but I knew that I needed to get out and try and give my kids a better life.\u201d Which again, he doesn\u2019t regret, but it does add a layer of confusion to his family life. \u201cTrying to instil working-class values in kids who are being driven around in a fucking Bentley is very difficult, you know?\u201d He moved to Essex, had more children, and went viral a number of times for his political commentary. (One memorable clip from 2018 saw him opposite Jeremy Corbyn on Good Morning Britain questioning why David Cameron, \u201cthat twat\u201d had \u201cdisappeared\u201d amid the Brexit chaos. \u201cHe\u2019s in Nice with his trotters up! He should be held accountable for it!\u201d) Yet he says the press still associate him with violence. \u201cThe media have always labelled me \u2018hard-man Danny Dyer\u2019. I don\u2019t know where that\u2019s come from. Is it going back to classism and because I swear a lot? Is it that? It always seems to be about trying to bring me down and catch me out. Especially now in a world of cancel culture.\u201d In 2010, he was sacked from a ghost-written column in lads mag Zoo, for apparently advising a man who couldn\u2019t get over his ex-girlfriend to \u201ccut his ex\u2019s face, then no one will want her\u201d. It had been a line from a film, he said he\u2019d been misquoted, but the backlash was serious and still impacts the way he\u2019s seen. \u201cEverything\u2019s divisive, you know. We\u2019re all being segregated, we\u2019ve regressed as a human race, I feel. There\u2019s no love. Why the fuck are we not looking after each other as human beings? What\u2019s going on? It\u2019s probably because the elite have been exposed a little bit. And the media are fighting back, making us go, well, you\u2019re either this or you\u2019re that. You can\u2019t be all things.\u201d We\u2019re meeting the week before the election, and Dyer\u2019s ambivalent about voting. He sighs. \u201cWhat does worry me, I suppose, is the Tories have fucked it so much that they disappear off the face of the earth, and then Labour get in and there\u2019s no one to challenge them. There\u2019s just something about Starmer I can\u2019t quite buy into. I feel he\u2019s trying too hard to be a common person.\u201d Watching the debates, he found himself asking, \u201c\u2018What the fuck? You are a knight, but you\u2019re meant to be part of a working-class party?\u2019 I just despair at it all and don\u2019t really believe a lot of what they say. Let\u2019s see what the fuck happens and hopefully it changes for the better. I pray, for everybody\u2019s sanity.\u201d He downs his coffee, bitterly. \u201cI don\u2019t know, darling, we\u2019re so lost. Everybody hates the Tories and quite rightly, but we\u2019re not inspired by the Labour party. Who the fuck do we trust? We need more working-class people in politics, it\u2019s very simple. Maybe they\u2019ll put Angela Rayner in later, when Keir gets found out. I watch her and go, \u2018I believe you. I believe your soul.\u2019 And they\u2019re all pretty soulless at the moment, I think.\u201d He shrugs. When Dyer made How to be a Man, his most recent documentary, \u201cI felt the idea of masculinity was being manipulated,\u201d he says. I mention Nigel Farage\u2019s recent praise of Andrew Tate and his defence of \u201cmale culture\u201d. Dyer leans back. \u201cAndrew Tate only exists because the media write about how masculinity is toxic. That\u2019s how you create a space for Andrew Tate to exist. Some of the stuff he says is very fucking interesting. The problem is, he\u2019s such a cock. It\u2019s OK to want to be a provider and protector, it\u2019s a natural instinct for a man. But if we\u2019re going to keep bollocking men for being too masculine and also bollocking them for not opening up about their feelings\u2026 You can\u2019t have it both ways.\u201d He sees how his daughters \u201cthink they want a bit of a prick, someone who\u2019s unattainable, a bad boy. But actually later on in life, which is what Dani\u2019s learned, they want a man who\u2019s going to be strong and there for her.\u201d He looks like he\u2019s welling up when he talks about her partner, West Ham forward Bowen. \u201cWhat Jarrod did by taking on her son at 18 months old, it says a lot about a man.\u201d And to have a West Ham player as a son-in-law? He grins. \u201cThat\u2019s a real bonus for me as a dad.\u201d his new era, as a 46-year-old grandfather to three toddlers, pointing now to the dummy on the counter. \u201cEvery day is a fucking lesson to me and throwing being a grandad into the mix, it\u2019s a fucking amazing feeling.\u201d He describes the logistics of babysitting as if it\u2019s a football game, gesturing with swift firm movements. \u201cSo you\u2019ve got twins that are one, and all they want to do is kill themselves. So what they do is they wait for that door to open and they make a bolt for it so they can roll down the stairs.\u201d He is responsible for making sure they don\u2019t die. \u201cBut at the same time, you\u2019ve got the three-year-old running around smashing shit up and he likes to wind us up by opening the door.\u201d A footballer\u2019s career is short, he points out, so while Dani is parenting alone much of the time now, Bowen will be back with his family for good in a few years. Dyer can relate to the idea of sacrificing your home life for a career. \u201cIt\u2019s all intense and it\u2019s wonderful and then you just wake up one day and it\u2019s done, and then you come back to your life.\u201d He picks up the dice again. \u201cYou commit completely fully, you hold your soul to it, and then it stops, and then you have to come back and sort of just, shrug it off, you know what I mean?\u201d In his new comedy, Mr Bigstuff, Dyer\u2019s character arrives to teach his estranged brother how to be a man. \u201cIt\u2019s like, you need to find that inner cunt inside you. And when I use that word, it\u2019s all about intent.\u201d What is a perfect man? \u201cI would like to think the perfect man will be able to build you a cupboard, but also like a bit of a gossip. So I can curl up on the sofa and watch Marley and Me and cry. But also be able to throw his missus around the bedroom like a caveman.\u201d As he entered his 40s, Dyer realised he was questioning himself less. \u201cI know what I\u2019m about now \u2013 you tend to not care so much about what people fucking think about you.\u201d Looking in the makeup mirror on a recent job, he says: \u201cI started to notice I was going bald, but I realise that\u2019s part of the ageing process. I understand I\u2019m starting to be the shape of an avocado. But that\u2019s what a middle-aged body is. And I\u2019m accepting it. I smoke and I drink, I like to enjoy life, and I don\u2019t want to become a person who calls potatoes \u2018carbs\u2019. I don\u2019t want white bread to be the enemy. So I\u2019m a middle-aged man and I enjoy it.\u201d He gazes briefly, proudly around his clean white house and Debbie huffs her way towards him, collapsing like a tyre at his feet. \u201cIt\u2019s weird getting older, because you become aware of how long you\u2019ve got left. I reckon I\u2019ve got another half my life to go\u201d \u2013 finally, he throws the dice \u2013 \u201cand I intend to enjoy it.\u201d All episodes of Mr Bigstuff are available on Sky and NOW from 17 July Styling by Helen Seamons and Steph Stevens; photographer\u2019s assistant Adam Orzechowski; grooming by Dani Guinsberg using Shakeup Cosmetics",

        "text": "The text messages that open Brittney Griner\u2019s memoir are a chilling short story. \u201cHey baby I got stopped by security at customs.\u201d \u201cIf you don\u2019t hear from me for like one hour or more get my agent on the phone.\u201d \u201cWake up plz.\u201d \u201cBaby text me plz I\u2019m freaking out.\u201d \u201cBaby.\u201d \u201cHello.\u201d \u201cThis is it for me.\u201d The date was 17 February 2022 and Griner, one of the best basketball players in the world, was at a Moscow airport on her way to meet up with UMMC Ekaterinburg, for whom she played in the WNBA off-season. Back at her Arizona home it was 2am and her wife, Relle, was sleeping. Two near-empty vials of medicinal cannabis oil had just been found in Griner\u2019s bag. Her phone and passport were taken, and she was made to sign a document in a language she didn\u2019t understand. After 19 hours at customs, she was led away in handcuffs. \u201cThe future,\u201d she writes in Coming Home, \u201cwas unimaginable.\u201d Days later, Russia invaded Ukraine. The detention of an American double Olympic champion on drugs charges was a political plot-point, and Griner\u2019s ordeal was sealed. While her family, friends and fellow athletes lobbied the White House to secure her release, celebrities including Justin Bieber and Jada Pinkett Smith joined their #WeAreBG campaign to keep up the pressure. It took nine months before state officials finally brought Griner home through a prisoner exchange. In this book she reveals the reality of what she went through during that time and the result is a biography that could legitimately be shelved under horror. The details may be grim but it\u2019s the descent into powerlessness that is so disturbing, as Griner is sucked into a draconian and corrupt penal system where her future freedom depends on no less comforting a figure than Vladimir Putin himself. It is some feat to create so much suspense in a story when the world already knows the outcome. The tension builds from the very first page, as we\u2019re thrown at pace into the entirely avoidable accident that precipitates events. Griner, rushing for a flight, throws her travel items into a carry-on she hasn\u2019t properly checked. She misses her plane from JFK, catches the next. \u201cIf my day had gone as planned,\u201d she muses, later. \u201cIf. If. If.\u201d Instead, in an unusually busy customs hall, the 6ft 9in black athlete is among a group of foreigners pulled out of the line for a bag search, and in a zipped pocket at the back is a forgotten vape cartridge. Its contents aren\u2019t enough to get anyone high, but they are enough to land her a charge of smuggling as well as possession. We follow Griner\u2019s nightmare journey through various places of imprisonment. Denied bail, she was held ahead of trial at a women\u2019s prison outside Moscow, reliant on the kindness of an English-speaking cellmate, Alena, to help her navigate her way through its rules and routines. The squalor and humiliations mount, from the rusty-brown showers to the strip-searches from guards who refuse to believe she\u2019s a woman. In one filthy basement cell, \u201cthe walls were covered in black soot and piss, or whatever bodily fluid I smelled\u201d. After the shock of her sentencing \u2013 Griner received nine years, nearly the maximum penalty \u2013 she is transported to a former gulag and the train journey takes over a week. Lying inside a cage, on a metal bunk far too small for her frame, she regrets the loss of one of her few possessions, the sudoku book that she had kept with her since her arrest. Relle had already completed one of the puzzles and signed her name next to it. \u201cWhen I felt down I turned to that page and rubbed her signature on my cheek.\u201d Griner\u2019s co-writer, Michelle Burford, a founding editor of O, The Oprah Magazine, weaves the swooping drama of the high-stakes narrative with empathic glimpses of Griner\u2019s upbringing. Growing up black and extremely tall attracted plenty of unwelcome attention, while her parents worried there was something medically wrong with her. When she came out, her father, Ray, who had fought in the Vietnam war before becoming a policeman, yelled at her (\u201cI ain\u2019t raising no gay bitch!\u201d) and she left home. And yet their ongoing love for each other is palpable, and the toughness he instilled in her helped her survive in prison. We learn, too, about the efforts that Relle, a lawyer, and Griner\u2019s tireless agent, Lindsay Kagawa Colas, were making while she grappled with the prospect of being incarcerated for a decade. \u201cA freedom campaign has a question at its heart,\u201d writes Griner: \u201c\u2018Who deserves our sympathy?\u2019\u201d It is, perhaps, the book\u2019s most powerful and poignant question. Griner\u2019s story ends not with her return to the WNBA, but with a list of Americans still held hostage around the world, including former marine Paul Whelan and Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich in Russia. Her book should also shout a warning about the dangerous political waters in which the sports industry defiantly continues to swim. Perhaps it\u2019s unreasonable to expect women\u2019s basketballers to turn down life-changing sums to play in an overseas league run by oligarchs and former spies, especially when their own national league makes them fly economy. But you can question the \u201cbubble\u201d mentality and moral ignorance that accompanies the decision-making of both the athletes and those running international sport. Griner herself loved the seven years she played in Russia and admits: \u201cI couldn\u2019t see the dirty politics, the corruption, the old-school views of women.\u201d The country\u2019s record on LGBTQ+ rights didn\u2019t seem to factor either, since she herself always felt safe. What is so frightening about sportswashing, from the Qatari World Cup to Saudi Arabia\u2019s LIV Golf and Pro League football, is that it appears irresistible to athletes, administrators and fans alike. Even since Griner\u2019s arrest, a number of Americans, including current WNBA players Kayla Thornton and Monique Billings, continued to play in the Russian league. Some who find the prospect too uncomfortable have headed to Turkey instead. Griner herself has made a successful return to basketball and will represent the USA in the Olympics later this month. Her professional comeback is all the more extraordinary given the difficulties she has continued to face, from PTSD episodes to security threats that required her and Relle to sell their home. The couple are expecting the birth of their first child this month: expect Griner\u2019s story to be one of the most talked about in Paris.",

        "text": "Keir Starmer has promised a new era of closer relations with Europe to ensure future generations can look back \u201con what our continent achieved together\u201d before a key meeting of European leaders this week. Starmer said Europe as a whole faced security crises and linked problems over migration, and that Britain should be at the heart of the continent\u2019s efforts to confront them. In his most positive comments about the UK and Europe since he campaigned against Brexit and for a second referendum, the prime minister said that Europe was \u201cat the forefront of some of the greatest challenges of our time\u201d. Speaking before a meeting at Blenheim Palace on Thursday of the European Political Community, he said: \u201cRussia\u2019s barbaric war continues to reverberate across our continent, while vile smuggling gangs traffic innocent people on perilous journeys that too often end in tragedy. \u201cWe cannot be spectators in this chapter of history. We must do more and go further, not just for the courageous Ukrainians on the frontlines, or those being trafficked from country to country, but so our future generations look back with pride at what our continent achieved together. \u201cI said I would change the way the UK engages with our European partners, working collaboratively to drive forward progress on these generational challenges,and that work starts at the European Political Community meeting on Thursday.\u201d Starmer has repeatedly ruled out rejoining the EU, its single market or customs union. As opposition leader, he was reluctant to express his pro-Europeanism for fear of being accused of wanting to reverse Brexit. But now, after his emphatic election win, UK and European diplomats are detecting a shift in tone. The first step is likely to see the UK and EU move towards a new security pact to deal better with issues such as Ukraine. There is also speculation that there could be agreements on a new youth mobility scheme and possibly, further down the line, mutual recognition of some professional qualifications. Downing Street said the prime minister was clear: \u201cThe United Kingdom is always stronger when working in close collaboration with others.\u201d A statement said: \u201cThe UK government will use the summit to discuss closer collaboration to tackle illegal immigration and greater security cooperation with European counterparts to keep Britain safe.\u201d Before the summit, the prime minister will host the Irish taoiseach, Simon Harris, for his first official visit since entering Downing Street. The prime minister will also hold a bilateral dinner with the French president, Emmanuel Macron, in Blenheim Palace, the birthplace of Winston Churchill, after the summit. The EPC was set up by Macron in 2022 to tackle issues that could best be addressed outside the formal EU structures. The EPC meeting comes after a stepping up of Russian aggression in Ukraine. Starmer has been clear that the UK\u2019s support for Ukraine is guaranteed and that he will use the meeting as a platform to push for continued international military and financial backing. Starmer said in Washington last week that he had discussed a \u201cformal mechanism\u201d for UK-EU security cooperation during bilateral meetings at the Nato summit, and that a plan to repair post-Brexit damage had been well received by allies. President Joe Biden told Starmer: \u201cI kind of see you guys as the knot tying the transatlantic alliance together, the closer you are with Europe.\u201d Starmer said at the close of the summit: \u201cThere was a sense after Brexit that the UK has become too inward looking, was not as interested as it once was in its place on the global stage. The UK is confident, is back.\u201d Peter Ricketts, a former British ambassador to France, said: \u201cSunak has gifted Starmer the perfect platform to consolidate his position as a leading figure on European security, with Biden, Macron and Scholz all in deep electoral trouble. In my experience, the parliamentary training makes UK politicians effective at chairing and brokering solutions at big meetings, and the FCDO will have prepared the ground well.So this is a real opportunity to show that Britain is back at the centre of diplomacy.\u201d",

        "text": "When the new British prime minister, Keir Starmer, invited Wes Streeting into Downing Street to appoint him health secretary on Friday 5 July, the exchanges behind closed doors were entirely cordial. But things rarely run 100% smoothly in the first days of a new administration as a complete government jigsaw is put together, piece by piece. According to a well-placed source, when Streeting left the prime minister\u2019s office, Bridget Phillipson was waiting her turn outside. A very senior civil servant was helping to oversee the process and, ushering Streeting out and Phillipson in, is said to have mistakenly referred to the former as \u201ceducation secretary\u201d. \u201cNot surprisingly, it did not go down well [with Phillipson], until he corrected himself,\u201d said the source. \u201cBridget got the job she expected, but for a second or two, things were apparently a bit tense, to say the least.\u201d Broadly speaking, however, the transition from Tory to a Labour administration has gone as smoothly as anyone could have hoped for. In some instances, it has gone rather too well. When Ed Miliband walked into the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero and addressed civil servants for the first time, there was so much cheering and \u201cwhooping\u201d that a senior mandarin in the department had to tell those making the noise to pipe down, fearing it sounded more like a political rally than a respectful welcome from an entirely neutral Whitehall machine. \u201cI think the intended message was that you can\u2019t, as civil servants, make it sound too much like you are thrilled to have the Tories out, even though it felt like everyone was,\u201d said an insider. Similarly rapturous welcomes were given to other new ministers: Liz Kendall at work and pensions, Phillipson at education and Shabana Mahmood at justice. On Monday afternoon, when Streeting addressed staff assembled in the canteen at the Department of Health and Social Care, the place was stuffed to overflowing. Streeting had invited NHS England employees to be there too, to show that he wanted everyone to work together to mend what he has called a \u201cbroken\u201d service. Streeting told them he wanted to be challenged and presented with hard truths. \u201cThere was an incredible atmosphere,\u201d said one person who was there. Another said: \u201cIt was like a massive, massive relief and change of mood.\u201d This weekend, the new government is enjoying, and feeding off, a wave of positivity, not just in Westminster and Whitehall but across the country. Somewhat fortunately for Starmer and his ministers, their moment \u2013 and the arrival of 334 new MPs in Westminster \u2013 has coincided with a patriotic frenzy caused by England reaching the final of Euro 2024 and some better economic news. Friday\u2019s Financial Times led with the headline: \u201cSterling surges as GDP data buoys Labour growth agenda\u201d \u2013 wrapping the themes of political and economic optimism into one. Members of the new government seemed genuinely excited and encouraged last week by the public response to Westminster\u2019s changing of the guard. \u201cThe most striking thing for me,\u201d said one front-rank Labour minister, \u201cis how many people have just come up to me in the street or on the train and said: \u2018So glad you are there, good luck \u2013 so pleased to have seen the back of the Tories.\u2019\u201d In parliament, the new intake arrived on Monday and Tuesday in massed ranks, symbols of a new political era, many of them youthful, wide-eyed and in awe. Vikki Slade, the new Liberal Democrat MP for Mid Dorset and North Poole, could not believe how her workplace functioned and the reverence with which she was treated from the off. \u201cI was walking towards the members\u2019 lobby [outside the chamber] and two officials just opened the doors for me, on either side, to let me through. I couldn\u2019t believe it,\u201d she said. Her colleague James MacCleary, who won Lewes for the Lib Dems, felt he was suffering from \u201cimpostor syndrome\u201d when he was shown a round the Commons chamber. \u201cI said I presumed I was not allowed to sit down on the green benches yet and they said: \u2018You are an MP now \u2013 of course you are allowed to sit there.\u2019\u201d Some long-serving MPs, veterans of the previous parliament, said they felt a little left out, as if tainted by association with discredited political times. \u201cThe new intake is getting all the attention. We have to do something to show it is not just about them,\u201d said one. \u201cIt is all a bit weird.\u201d Recently appointed Labour ministers who had worked for their moment for years struggled to sum up their feelings. Speaking to the Observer after a day in post, one said: \u201cI have gone from a pokey office in Portcullis House to a floor of a major department with the civil servants all around. It is quite extraordinary. Suddenly, I feel like we have this massive opportunity to get things done.\u201d But will they succeed? Behind the euphoria, there is trepidation. Labour ministers and MPs know full well that the honeymoon will not last. They are asking themselves how, given the dire state of public services \u2013 overcrowded prisons, an overburdened and understaffed NHS, schools with crumbling buildings and a shortage of teachers \u2013 and the lack of money in Treasury coffers, can they turn things around before the public mood sours again? Another new minister said there was absolutely no time to waste. \u201cI would say we have two and a half years to make an impression before the nerves set in again,\u201d he said. His point was after that juncture, his party, which secured just under 34% of the vote on 4 July despite gaining a huge majority, would be too fearful of threats from the left and right to do bold things and would start worrying about the next election. Over recent days, a good start has been made. The new chancellor, Rachel Reeves, has pledged a return to compulsory housebuilding targets and Miliband has revoked the Tories\u2019 de facto ban on onshore windfarms. Very deliberately, however, much of the emphasis has been on demonstrating the extent of the mess left by the Conservatives. Streeting\u2019s remarks about the broken NHS, and Starmer and Mahmood\u2019s decision to approve the release of thousands of prisoners to prevent a total breakdown in law and order, were not only designed to discredit the past regime but also to buy Labour time. \u201cThe more we can show how badly they left everything, the more people will realise it is not easy to fix and how important responsible government now is,\u201d said a Labour strategist. In a column for Friday\u2019s Guardian on his first week running the country, Starmer wrote of the Tory record: \u201cLike a Downing Street party, they\u2019ve left a mountain of mess for this government to clean up.\u201d Confidence among the new team of Labour ministers and MPs has been bolstered by the way Starmer has settled in so fast, seeming at ease with so much power and responsibility at his fingertips. As opposition leader and throughout the election campaign, the adjectives \u201cdull\u201d and \u201cwooden\u201d stuck to him like glue. \u201cNow he looks like he was absolutely made to be prime minister,\u201d said one of his senior ministers. On his first overseas trip as the nation\u2019s leader, to a Nato summit in Washington DC, Starmer looked and sounded the part, appearing centre stage in team photos, easefully handling a meeting with the increasingly frail US president, Joe Biden, joking about the football and, afterwards, effortlessly batting away questions about the president\u2019s mental state. On the way to Washington, Starmer had oozed confidence, risking a comment about England never having missed a single penalty under this Labour government. He and his wife, Victoria, have also received positive photo spreads in the pages of the Daily Mail, the Times and the Daily Telegraph. On Saturday, in an article in the Daily Mail, the rightwing columnist Leo McKinstry wrote: \u201cAs an unwavering opponent of Labour I was dreading Labour\u2019s socialist new dawn. But even I am reassured by Starmer\u2019s promising first week after years of chaos and division.\u201d This week, King Charles will unveil the new government\u2019s legislative programme for the forthcoming session of parliament. Amid great pageantry, Starmer and Rishi Sunak will walk side by side from the House of Commons to the Lords before the speech is read out. What they will discuss on the short journey will be the subject of much speculation among the commentators. The king\u2019s speech will contain a range of important bills on the NHS, standards in schools, mental health, energy and the environment. The message will be one of continued momentum, improving the nation\u2019s key public services and the pursuit above all of economic growth. The following day, Starmer will host more than 45 European leaders at Blenheim Palace in Oxfordshire for a meeting of the European Political Community. Much of the emphasis will be on closer defence cooperation between the UK and EU. But it is also expected that Starmer will use the occasion to start rebuilding relations with our European neighbours in a broader sense, both economically and politically, post-Brexit. One minister with some knowledge of the brief remarked: \u201cI don\u2019t think you will hear anything dramatic but there will be a change of tone. It will be another indication that this government wants to show it is serious about changing the country for the better.\u201d",

        "text": "The U.S. Secret Service is investigating how a gunman armed with an AR-style rifle was able to get close enough to shoot and injure former President Donald Trump at a rally Saturday in Pennsylvania, a monumental failure of one the agency\u2019s core duties. The gunman, who was killed by Secret Service personnel, fired multiple shots at the stage from an \u201celevated position outside of the rally venue,\u201d the agency said. An Associated Press analysis of more than a dozen videos and photos taken at the Trump rally, as well as satellite imagery of the site, shows the shooter, was able to get astonishingly close to the stage where the former president was speaking. A video posted to social media and geolocated by the AP shows the body of a man wearing gray camouflage lying motionless on the roof of a manufacturing plant just north of the Butler Farm Show grounds, where Trump\u2019s rally was held. The roof was less than 150 meters (yards) from where Trump was speaking, a distance from which a decent marksman could reasonably hit a human-sized target. For reference, 150 meters is a distance at which U.S. Army recruits must hit a scaled human-sized silhouette to qualify with the M16 assault rifle in basic training. The AR-15, like the shooter at the Trump rally had, is the semi-automatic civilian version of the military M16. The FBI early Sunday identified the shooter as Thomas Matthew Crooks, 20, of Bethel Park, Pennsylvania. The Secret Service didn\u2019t have anybody at a late-night news conference where FBI and Pennsylvania State Police officials briefed reporters on the shooting investigation. FBI Special Agent in Charge Kevin Rojek said it was \u201csurprising\u201d that the gunman was able to fire at the stage before he was killed. Members of the Secret Service\u2019s counter sniper team and counter assault team were at the rally, according to two law enforcement officials. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren\u2019t authorized to discuss details of the investigation. The heavily-armed counter assault team, whose Secret Service code name is \u201cHawkeye,\u201d is responsible for eliminating threats so that other agents can shield and take away the person they are protecting. The counter sniper team, known by the code name \u201cHercules,\u201d uses long-range binoculars and is equipped with sniper rifles to deal with long-range threats. U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas said his department and the Secret Service are working with law enforcement to investigate the shooting. Maintaining the security of presidential candidates and their campaign events is one of the department\u2019s \u201cmost vital priorities,\u201d he said. \u201cWe condemn this violence in the strongest possible terms and commend the Secret Service for their swift action today,\u201d Mayorkas said. \u201cWe are engaged with President Biden, former President Trump and their campaigns, and are taking every possible measure to ensure their safety and security.\u201c Calls for an investigation came from all sides. James Comer, a Kentucky Republican who is the House Oversight Committee chairman, said he contacted the Service Service for a briefing and called on Director Kimberly Cheatle to appear for a hearing. Comer said his committee will send a formal invitation soon. \u201cPolitical violence in all forms is unamerican and unacceptable. There are many questions and Americans demand answers,\u201d Comer said in a statement. U.S. Rep. Ritchie Torres, a New York Democrat, called for investigating \u201csecurity failures\u201d at the rally. \u201cThe federal government must constantly learn from security failures in order to avoid repeating them, especially when those failures have implications for the nation,\u201d Torres said. Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers, a Democrat, posted on X that he and his staff are in contact with security planning coordinators ahead of the Republican National Convention set to begin Monday in Milwaukee. \u201cWe cannot be a country that accepts political violence of any kind \u2014 that is not who we are as Americans,\u201d Evers said. The FBI said it will lead the investigation into the shooting, working with the Secret Service and local and state law enforcement. Attorney General Merrick Garland said the Justice Department \u201cwill bring every available resource to bear to this investigation.\u201d \u201cMy heart is with the former President, those injured, and the family of the spectator killed in this horrific attack,\u201d Garland said in a statement. \u201cWe will not tolerate violence of any kind, and violence like this is an attack on our democracy.\u201d ___ By Michael Biesecker and Michael Kunzelman Associated Press Associated Press writers Colleen Long and Zeke Miller in Washington contributed to this report.",

        "text": "The attempted assassination of Donald Trump by a gunman at his Pennsylvania rally has confirmed the worst fears of public figures warning that an escalation in incendiary political rhetoric on all sides could lead to bloodshed.US lawmakers and analysts have been voicing concern since the 2021 US Capitol riot that increasingly bellicose campaign language was becoming a worrying contusion on the US body politic ahead of November's presidential election. The danger was vividly illustrated in 2022, when then-House speaker Nancy Pelosi's husband was attacked with a hammer by a far-right conspiracy theorist who wanted to hold the Democratic leader hostage and \"break her kneecaps.\"The political affiliations of Saturday's shooter, identified as 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks, were not immediately clear -- but analysts and politicians immediately pointed the finger at extreme political discourse.\"For weeks Democrat leaders have been fueling ludicrous hysteria that Donald Trump winning re-election would be the end of democracy in America,\" House Republican Majority Leader Steve Scalise, who was seriously wounded in a mass shooting at a congressional sports event in 2017, said on X.\"Clearly we've seen far left lunatics act on violent rhetoric in the past. This incendiary rhetoric must stop.\"Senior Trump campaign aide Chris LaCivita assailed the language of \"leftist activists, Democrat donors and even Joe Biden.\" While Ajamu Baraka, Green Party candidate Jill Stein's running mate in 2016, suggested Democratic rhetoric might have led the gunman to see it as his \"patriotic duty to eliminate an existential threat to the nation.\" \"The chickens have really come home to roost,\" he posted on X.What none of the three acknowledged was that Trump himself has been a major architect of the coarsening in US political discourse in recent years.Many of Trump's targets in Congress and the government -- from Republican Senator Mitt Romney to retired top government scientist Anthony Fauci -- have disclosed having to take on private security after threats from Trump's supporters.The former US president sparked fury last year when he implied that the country's top military officer should be executed, and joked about the Pelosi hammer attack.Trump's exhortations to violence are nothing new -- he suggested that protesters should be \"roughed up\" at a rally in 2016, and that looters should be shot during the 2020 racial protests over the police murder of George Floyd. He has also repeatedly described the attorneys leading the multiple civil and criminal cases he faces as \"monster,\" \"deranged\" and \"psycho.\"And, of course, many argue he incited the deadly Capitol riot on January 6, 2021, when he exhorted his followers to \"fight like hell\" shortly before they stormed the seat of US government, leaving five people dead. Republicans have in the past accused Democrats of overreacting to figurative language and ignoring leftist aggression, such as harassment of conservative Supreme Court justices and the 2017 shooting that wounded Scalise.Still, law enforcement agencies say that while threats have proliferated from every corner, right-wing violence is the bigger worry. Discourse that was once taboo is now commonplace on the far right, with Republican flamethrowers in Congress incorporating violent language and imagery into their stump speeches.Threats against members of Congress of all stripes reached a record high of 9,625 in 2021, according to data provided by the Capitol Police, compared with just 3,939 in 2017.Robert Pape of the University of Chicago has conducted several polls on political violence since the Capitol assault. In his latest last month, 10 percent of respondents said the use of force was \"justified to prevent Donald Trump from becoming president.\"\"The shooting of former President Trump is a consequence of such significant support for political violence in our country,\" he told AFP. \"We also need to worry about threat in retribution to President Biden. Our survey shows seven percent of American adults -- 18 million -- support force to restore Trump to the presidency, half of whom own guns.\" Political analyst Charlie Kolean called for Americans to stand together \"in condemning such violence and work towards ensuring the safety and security of all public officials.\" \"Today's events are a stark reminder of the threats our leaders face,\" Kolean, the chief strategy officer at conservative-leaning political consultancy RED PAC, told AFP.\"An attack on the presidential candidate is an attack on our democracy.\"",

        "text": "CAROLINA, Puerto Rico -- Vianca Bra\u00f1a never used to attend basketball games in her hometown of Carolina, Puerto Rico \u2014 or anywhere else in the United States territory. But in recent years, the 23-year-old has left the arena with a hoarse voice, often wearing a T-shirt that reads \u201cCarola,\u201d a nickname for her town. \u201cWe started making this fun, and I wanted to represent the town where I'm from,\u201d said Bra\u00f1a, who attended her first game the year Puerto Rican reggaeton star Bad Bunny bought a team in the island\u2019s professional men\u2019s basketball league. It was also around that time that she began placing bets on different teams across Puerto Rico with her girlfriends. Bra\u00f1a\u2019s fervor illustrates how Puerto Rico's professional men's basketball league is experiencing a revival, driven by reggaeton stars like Bad Bunny, Ozuna and Anuel AA, who are stepping into the financial game, buying local teams and helping to stack up a loyal fan base the island hasn\u2019t witnessed in over 40 years. What were once half-empty arenas in Puerto Rico are now packed, filled with families and young fans cheering for their favorite teams, from Los Capitanes de Arecibo in northern Puerto Rico to Los Leones de Ponce in the south. Attendance more than doubled from 2018 to 2023, skyrocketing from some 480,000 tickets sold to nearly 1 million, according to Puerto Rico's professional men\u2019s basketball league, whose digital presence has also soared in the past few years. A pivotal moment in the league\u2019s revival came in 2021, when three-time Grammy winner Bad Bunny became co-owner of Los Cangrejeros de Santurce, along with his manager, Noah Assad. Bad Bunny\u2019s frequent game-day visits sparked a resurgence in Puerto Rico's basketball scene. Other artists like Anuel AA quickly followed, buying Arecibo\u2019s Capitanes team before a new owner took over in 2023, and Ozuna acquiring Manat\u00ed\u2019s team, renaming it Los Osos, in 2022. The league, known as BSN, currently has 12 teams playing, compared with nine just four years ago. Basketball games have transformed into premier rendezvous events, attracting celebrities like NBA legend LeBron James, former boxer Floyd Mayweather and reggaeton artists including Arcangel and Rauw Alejandro, capturing audiences of all ages hoping to get a glimpse of them. \u201cWhen Noah and Bad Bunny came along, we generated a lot of noise,\u201d said Ricardo Dalmau, president of BSN. \u201cIt was an explosion of attention.\u201d Dalmau said local TV ratings also saw an upward tick after they began broadcasting some games in 2021, with the biggest surprise being their largest viewership block: women ages 18 to 49, a new audience that was also reflected in the bleachers. \u201cYou never know what artist you\u2019re going to find in the (league),\u201d he said. Before its recent surge in popularity, the league was under financial strain. Although Dalmau did not provide specific numbers, he said there used to be a lot of uncertainty about whether certain teams would participate or whether the league could fulfill players\u2019 contracts. \u201cWe don't have those problems anymore,\" he said. Javier Sabath, a popular basketball commentator on the island, said he is witnessing what his father \u2014 a sports commentator himself decades ago \u2014 describes as the environment in the 1980s, the heyday of the league. \u201cNew generations have never seen this before,\u201d Sabath said. \u201cThe boom with urban artists revived the Puerto Rican sports history that had been forgotten.\u201d Sabath said the momentum created by artists has fueled fans\u2019 excitement beyond just seeing reggaeton stars. \u201cIndirectly, these artists are attracting enough attention to make people interested in our league,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a domino effect.\u201d A bittersweet moment took place recently, when Puerto Rico national men\u2019s basketball team, composed of several of the league\u2019s star players, qualified for the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris. The victory over Lithuania broke a 20-year drought for the team that last competed in 2004, beating the USA team in the Athens Olympics. It is also a loss for the league\u2019s teams playing later in the summer. The league\u2019s renaissance comes after its peak over 40 years ago. Teams in Bayam\u00f3n, Quebradillas, Ponce and other towns had produced renowned players, including Butch Lee, the first Puerto Rican player to enter the National Basketball Association; Raymond Dalmau, whose son currently presides over the league; and Rub\u00e9n Rodr\u00edguez, who played for Los Vaqueros in Bayam\u00f3n. As part of the current frenzy, ex-NBA players have moved to Puerto Rico in recent years to join the league. Will Barton and Jared Sullinger play for San Juan\u2019s team, while other ex-NBA players like DeMarcus Cousins, Lance Stephenson and Brandon Knight also joined before moving on to other stints. Still, some problems remain beyond the league\u2019s control, including severe budget cuts, with the government slashing the island\u2019s sports and recreation department budget by more than half over the past decade. A lack of investment and maintenance in sports arenas across the island has caused leaks, leading to game suspensions after heavy rains. \u201cDespite the lack of economic resources, we\u2019ve been able to sort it out,\u201d said Ray Qui\u00f1ones, secretary of sports and recreation of Puerto Rico, whose infrastructure budget was cut from about $15,300 in 2014 to barely $7,500 in 2024. Sports arenas face the additional problem of chronic power outages across Puerto Rico, which is still rebuilding its electric grid after Hurricane Mar\u00eda, a Category 4 storm that razed the island in September 2017. In June, a game in Carolina between the home team, Los Gigantes, and Los Indios of Mayag\u00fcez was suspended after a widespread power outage left more than 340,000 customers without electricity. A month earlier, a game in San Juan\u2019s main arena was also suspended due to a power outage. Despite the challenges, younger generations are finding refuge outside their homes \u2014 which also contend with frequent power outages \u2014 and a new sense of pride by attending the games. For fans like Annais Ram\u00edrez, basketball arenas feel like safe spaces, especially for women looking to engage in historically male-dominated areas. \u201cThere are so many artists coming to the games, and you wonder if you\u2019ll run into one,\u201d the 27-year-old said as she stood next to her friend, who sported a necklace with a diamond-encrusted \u201cC\u201d for the town of Carolina. Her love for Carolina\u2019s team has grown beyond her expectation to run into a celebrity. During her free time, Ram\u00edrez goes on social media to catch up on the games she couldn\u2019t attend in person, checking out highlights, halftime performances and crowd reactions. \u201cThose motivate you to be part of the movement,\u201d she said. \u201cOn weekdays, this helps me unwind.\u201d ___ Follow AP\u2019s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america",

        "text": "France does not know where its government is headed and on Sunday the armed forces will also take an unusual detour at the start of their annual Bastille Day march.Preparations to host the Olympic Games blocked the national day parade from its traditional route on the Champs Elysees, and a smaller military contingent will instead march on the nearby Avenue Foch -- one of the most prestigious streets in Paris and one of the most expensive addresses in the world.This will not be the only unusual feature of the the event: France is also without a government, less than two weeks before the Games.All eyes will be on the host, President Emmanuel Macron, who last year cut a more impressive figure, hosting rising superpower India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi at France's triumphant national day parade.But, with the Olympics just around the corner, France has no international star guest for this year's parade -- and French political leaders' minds will be elsewhere, pondering the power vacuum.This month's snap elections, called by Macron to clarify France's direction after the far right sent shockwaves through the political establishment by coming first in European polls, left the country without a ruling minority.Prime Minister Gabriel Attal is hanging on as caretaker head of government but the centrist Macron ally is now focusing on his own future, taking charge of his reduced party in parliament.Other figures are mobilising with an eye on the 2027 presidential race, but there is little sign of a ruling majority emerging from parliament, split between three loose camps.With government in limbo and Macron barred by the constitution from calling fresh elections for 12 months, far-right figurehead Marine Le Pen is eyeing the 2027 race with relish.Meanwhile, first place in the elections was claimed by a rapidly cobbled-together left-wing alliance, the New Popular Front (NFP), which now has the most MPs but no clear candidate for PM.Firebrand hardliner Jean-Luc Melenchon and his France Unbowed (LFI) party has alienated many even on the left, while the centre and right say they would not welcome his MPs into a coalition.The European Union's second largest economy, a nuclear-armed G7 power and permanent member of the UN Security Council, is thus rudderless, a troubling situation for markets and France's allies alike.Against this backdrop, the reduced and rerouted parade risks becoming a new symbol of drift, even with the addition of the arrival in Paris of the Olympic Torch, ahead of the July 26 to August 11 Games.No tank or armoured vehicle will take part, and only 4,000 foot soldiers will march, down from 6,500 last year, but the military fly-past will see 45 aeroplanes and 22 helicopters soar over Paris.Regiments honoured on the parade will include those from France's allies and former French colonies that took part in the country's 1944 World War II liberation 80 years ago.The parade's final section will also honour the Olympic spirit.Colonel Thibault Vallette of the elite Cadre Noir de Saumur cavalry school and 2016 equestrian gold medallist in Rio will be bringing the torch down the route before relay runners carry it around the capital.",

        "text": "10 Most Expensive Celebrity Divorces While celebrity divorces are not significantly different from common divorces, the thing that sets them apart is the large sums of money as well as assets that they part with. This becomes even more complicated when either of the partners or both are famous or extremely wealthy. Meanwhile, experts at EvenBetGaming conducted a comprehensive study to analyze and rank the most expensive celebrity divorces in history. Below are the 10 most costly celebrity divorces of all time including the staggering costs and intricate legal battles. 1. Bill Gates and Melinda Gates Bill Gates and Melinda Gates ended their 27-year marriage with a high-profile divorce in 2021. While talking about the decision, Melinda said, \"It wasn't one moment or one specific thing that happened. There just came a point in time where there was enough there that I realized it just wasn't healthy, and I couldn't trust what we had,\" as reported by PEOPLE. In a joint statement, they said, \"We no longer believe we can grow together as a couple in this next phase of our lives.\" Their divorce is the costliest ever, with a $76 billion settlement. Adjusted for inflation, it\u2019s worth $87.6 billion. 2. Jeff Bezos and MacKenzie Bezos On January 9, 2019, Jeff Bezos and his wife MacKenzie Bezos revealed their decision to part ways. On his X account, Jeff wrote, \"I'm grateful for her support and for her kindness in this process and am very much looking forward to our new relationship as friends and co-parents,\" as reported by Town and Country Magazine. With a staggering $38 billion settlement, now equivalent to $45.3 billion, Jeff and MacKenzie\u2019s divorce ranks second on this list. MacKenzie also stands out as one of the wealthiest women on the list, boasting a net worth of $40.6 billion. 3. Alec Wildenstein and Jocelyn Wildenstein In 1999, after 21 years of marriage, Alec and Jocelyn Wildenstein decided to part ways. According to the study, their divorce settlement, adjusted for inflation, is valued at a whopping $7 billion. Meanwhile, as reported by PEOPLE, talking about the couple, a longtime friend said, \"They were a reclusive couple. They had a tight group of friends and were very quiet people.\" Following the divorce, Jocelyn stayed away from the public spotlight, although she has faced multiple legal challenges in the years since. 4. Rupert Murdoch and Anna Murdoch Rupert Murdoch and Anna Murdoch shared 31 years, making it Rupert's longest marriage. The couple parted ways in April 1998 and finalized their divorce just two months later. Speaking about the divorce, Anna said, \u201cI thought we had a wonderful, happy marriage. Obviously, we didn\u2019t\u2026 I don\u2019t want to get too personal about this\u2026 but [he] was extremely hard, ruthless,\u201d as reported by The Independent. They ended their marriage with a $1.7 billion settlement, which comes up to $3.1 billion when adjusted for inflation. This hefty sum places their split at the fourth place. 5. Kanye West and Kim Kardashian Kim Kardashian and Kanye West officially filed for divorce in 2021, although the cracks in their marriage had started showing years before. As reported by PEOPLE, talking about the decision, Kardashian said, \"For so long, I did what made other people happy. And I think in the last two years I decided, I'm going to make myself happy. And that feels really good. And even if that created changes and caused my divorce, I think it's important to be honest with yourself about what really makes you happy. I've chosen myself.\" Their divorce ranks fifth among the most expensive, with settlements totaling $2.8 billion. 6. Adnan Khashoggi and Soraya Khashoggi Adnan Khashoggi, the flamboyant Saudi arms trader, skyrocketed to immense wealth during the 1970s and 1980s, showcasing luxury that dazzled even in those times. This Saudi billionaire entrepreneur and arms dealer held the record for the world's costliest divorce settlement for nearly two years. Although their divorce proceedings began in 1974, it wasn't until 1979 that Soraya Khashoggi filed her lawsuit, according to CNBC. Their divorce is ranked sixth, with their settlement amounting to a hefty sum of $2.8 billion. 7. Bernie Ecclestone and Slavica Ecclestone Bernie Ecclestone, the Formula One billionaire, divorced his wife Slavica Ecclestone after she left the Kensington residence as indicated by The Standard. The Ecclestones, who were together for 24 years before the marriage failed, are known to live a very simple lifestyle even though they were extremely wealthy. The couple met for the first time in 1982 at the Italian Grand Prix where Slavica was working as a model, and they got married in 1984. Their settlement of $2.4 billion, puts Bernie and Slavica\u2019s divorce at the seventh most expensive celebrity divorce in history. 8. Bill Gross and Sue Gross Bill Gross, the renowned bond investor, went through a very rough time in his personal life when he was divorcing his wife Sue Gross. Sue accused Bill of vandalizing their California mansion, killing the plants, and throwing dead fish into the vents. Bill, on the other hand, claimed that Sue came at him with a silver thing which may have been a knife, as reported by Business Insider. After 32 years of marriage, their split resulted in a $1.6 billion settlement, ranking them eighth on the list of the most expensive celebrity divorces. 9. Steve Wynn and Elaine Wynn Elaine Wynn first met Steve Wynn during their college days, marrying him in 1963. They parted ways in 1986, only to rekindle their relationship five years later. Their second marriage eventually ended in divorce once more in 2010. Talking about their divorce, Steve said, \"The instigation of these accusations is the continued work of my ex-wife Elaine Wynn, with whom I am involved in a terrible and nasty lawsuit in which she is seeking a revised divorce settlement,\" as reported by Town and Country Magazine. They stand ninth on the list with $1.4 billion in settlements. 10. Harold Hamm and Sue Ann Arnall Harold Hamm and Sue Ann Arnall's 2012 divorce marks the conclusion of this list, with a staggering $1.3 billion settlement, according to OK! Magazine. The couple's journey began at Continental, where Harold met Sue Ann, who was working as an attorney and holding various executive positions. They married in 1988 without the protection of a prenuptial agreement. When Sue Ann filed for divorce, she demanded half of the wealth Harold had amassed during their 26-year marriage, as reported by Business Insider.",

The FBI identified the shooter as 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks hours after the incident, reported NBC News. Thomas Crooks, who is reported to be from Pennsylvania, was allegedly killed by the Security Service shortly after shots rang out at the Pennsylvania rally. Secret Service, chief of Communications Anthony Guglielmi later confirmed that he had been \u201cneutralized.\u201d Photos that emerged from the scene suggested Thomas Crooks was a White male. Pennsylvania voter records suggest that Thomas Matthew Crooks was a registered Republican. Thomas Matthew Crooks was listed as a registered Republican and as per voter records, the concerned person had the same address and birth date as the ID'd gunman, reported NBC News. According to Federal Election Commission donor data, a person listed as Thomas Crooks of Pennsylvania was also recorded as donating $15 to ActBlue, a political action committee backing the Democrats, in June 2021. \"The shooter has been tentatively identified. It\u2019s a matter of doing biometric confirmations,\" said State Police Lieutenant Colonel George Bivens. Law enforcement authorities are investigating the incident but are yet to reveal a motive behind the shooting. Crooks allegedly sat on top of the roof of a manufacturing plant 130 yards away from the stage near the Pennsylvania rally, reported the New York Post. An AR-style rifle was recovered by his side shortly after he allegedly shot at Donald Trump. International leaders came out in support of Donald Trump, reported CNN. Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky wrote, \u201cI am appalled to learn about the shooting of former U.S. President Donald Trump at his rally in Pennsylvania. Such violence has no justification and no place anywhere in the world. Never should violence prevail. I am relieved to learn that Donald Trump is now safe and wish him a speedy recovery.\u201d Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif tweeted \u201cJust learned that former President Trump was shot at an election rally. This is a shocking development. I condemn all violence in politics. Wish the former President swift recovery and good health.\u201d Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr, said \u201cIt is with great relief that we receive the news that former President Donald Trump is fine and well after the attempt to assassinate him. Our thoughts and prayers are with him and his family. Together with all democracy-loving peoples around the world, we condemn all forms of political violence. The voice of the people must always remain supreme.\u201d The Editor's note: The alleged assassination attempt of Donald Trump is a developing story, and we\u2019ll update as we learn more.

And then in central France's Auvergne -- home to some of the nation's most beloved cheeses such as Saint-Nectaire, Cantal and Fourme d'Ambert -- she discovered the \"obligatory plate of cheese enjoyed after each meal\". These experiences set Bachurinskaya, alongside her husband, on a lifelong journey dedicated to making cheese, both before and after fleeing political repression in Belarus and resettling in Poland. \"We can't see our parents, or go back,\" said the 40-year-old from the city of Gomel in southeastern Belarus.\"But we can't think about that all of the time, we have to move forwards,\" she added.Bachurinskaya and her husband Alexei Kuchko, 42, remain in frequent contact with many other exiles, with whom they speak their native Belarusian rather than the Russian language preferred by the government back home.Hundreds of thousands have fled the country in the last few years following a crackdown on protests after President Alexander Lukashenko claimed victory in a 2020 presidential election that rights groups said was fraudulent.The couple arrived in Poland in late 2021 and are now settled on a farm in the village of Balazowka in the Carpathian Mountains, where they live alongside 37 sheep and five goats.The couple have been making cheese since ditching their office jobs in Minsk -- Bachurinskaya was a translator from Italian and Kuchko worked in marketing -- and settling in the northern Belarus countryside in 2015.Their efforts paid off with the duo specialising in farm-to-table artisanal cheese in a country where the agricultural sector remains largely linked to its collectivist past and where most farms are state-owned. Lukashenko -- a former collective farm director -- boasts that he has created a paradise for farmers. The reality on the ground and in the fields was very different, according to the couple. \"Let's imagine you want to buy French sheep in Belarus... If you're an average guy, no one will give you permission. If you're a friend of Lukashenko, you'll have everything,\" said Kuchko.Five years after they left the capital, Belarus was upended after Lukashenko claimed to have won 80 percent of the vote in polls, as he sought a sixth term as president. For weeks, tens of thousands took to the streets to protest against the alleged fraud. Under mounting pressure from the demonstrations, Lukashenko turned to Russian President Vladimir Putin for support, as he brutally cracked down on the protests. Opposition figures were rounded up and some allegedly tortured, while more than 300,000 of the country's 9.3 million residents fled abroad, according to UN figures. For months, Bachurinskaya and Kuchko feared arrest after campaigning for imprisoned opposition figure Viktor Babaryko. And then in late 2021, they decided it was time to leave the country.The couple managed to leave with their two horses by passing them off as racehorses, but parted with most of their livestock. Once across the border in Poland, they started to slowly rebuild after finding a piece of land and buying new sheep and goats. In their kitchen, they make around 10 varieties of cheese by hand, including one creation that Bachurinskaya says combines the \"piquant taste of goat cheese with the creaminess of brie\".The concoctions are later sold in the city of Krakow, a 90-minute drive away, or via their Instagram account, Krapacheese. Despite all the hardships, the couple say they remain grateful for what they have and the cheese they are able to share with the world. \"We have very little time to be sad,\" Bachurinskaya told AFP. \"And I'm happy about that.\"",

        "text": "The Pulitzer Prize-winning Associated Press photographer who captured the image of an injured, defiant Donald Trump waving his fist to a sea of supporters on Saturday after an apparent assassination attempt knew he had one task: to keep his camera on his subject. \u201cIt\u2019s a moment in history that you have to document, right?\u201d Evan Vucci told The Daily Beast by phone late Saturday, hours after he captured the shocking images. \u201cBeing a photographer, you have to, have to be there. I can\u2019t write about it later. I can\u2019t go back in time and get a redo. So you have to do your job.\u201d Vucci was one of the pool photographers on duty during Trump\u2019s late-day rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, one he perceived as a normal rally\u2014not unlike those he\u2019d covered before. Until, over his left shoulder, he heard gunshots. \u201cFrom there, I trained my lens on former President Trump,\u201d Vucci said. Thoughts of his safety? Didn\u2019t concern him. Thoughts of his surroundings? Irrelevant at that moment. All he cared about, he said, was what the conditions were to document history. \u201cWhat\u2019s going to happen next? What do I need to do? Where do I need to be? What is the light? What is the composition? So those are the things that starts to go through your head,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s very much in the mindset where you\u2019re just now doing your job.\u201d Videos captured Vucci racing toward the right side of the stage seconds after the shooting, as he believed it best to follow where the Secret Service agents were likely to escort Trump off the platform. \u201cThey stand them up, and then he starts pumping his fists to the crowd,\u201d Vucci said. \u201cAt that point you\u2019re just making sure that your composition is good and you\u2019re making the images that you need to make.\u201d Vucci\u2019s photos took the nation by storm, documenting a bloodied former president a week before he was set to secure the Republican nomination. His photos, along with those of peers such as New York Times veteran photographer Doug Mills and Getty Images\u2019 Anna Moneymaker, lit up all forms of news broadcasts and social media, a dark convergence of the virality of the digital age with the grim occasion of an assassination attempt on a U.S. leader. History has trained Vucci for such a moment, teaching him the patience and calm nature needed to remain steady when a scene takes a sharp, potentially violent turn. An AP photographer for about 21 years, he won a Pulitzer in 2021 for his breaking news coverage of the 2020 racial justice protests in Washington, D.C. after George Floyd\u2019s death, and he has covered wars, Washington, and almost everything in between. Vucci was also known for capturing the face of the Iraqi journalist who threw a shoe at President George W. Bush\u2014though not Bush ducking to avoid the shoe, a moment he\u2019s still frustrated by. \u201cBush ducking the shoe I never got because I was on the shoe thrower,\u201d he said. \u201cYou just want to do the best you can so people can look back on it and be like, \u2018Yeah, that was a moment in history.\u2019 And here we are.\u201d Vucci wasn\u2019t bothered by the rising conversation around his photos\u2019 political significance, which pundits online noted how the striking shot of a bloodied Trump displaying strength\u2014literally, in clenching his fist\u2014 could help tilt the election in his favor. \u201cI shoot politics for a living, man. Every single photo I take people are going to argue about,\u201d Vucci said with a laugh. \u201cI spend my life around a very highly polarized part of our society, so no matter what I do, people are gonna hate it. People are gonna love it. Listen, as long as everyone hates me equally, I\u2019m doing the job.\u201d That responsibility guided Vucci through the harrowing moments on Saturday, producing photos that will help drive political discourse through the election and be imprinted in the minds of Americans\u2014and likely history books\u2014for generations. \u201cI\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t let anyone down. I got a standard to hold,\u201d Vucci said. \u201cI got into journalism to, you know\u2014the idea is to inform the American public, and I hope that they can look at the photos and they can see what I saw that day.\u201d",

        "text": "By Michael Biesecker and Michael Kunzelman, Associated Press The U.S. Secret Service is investigating how a gunman armed with an AR-style rifle was able to get close enough to shoot and injure former President Donald Trump at a rally Saturday in Pennsylvania, a monumental failure of one the agency\u2019s core duties. The gunman, who was killed by Secret Service personnel, fired multiple shots at the stage from an \u201celevated position outside of the rally venue,\u201d the agency said. An Associated Press analysis of more than a dozen videos and photos taken at the Trump rally, as well as satellite imagery of the site, shows the shooter was able to get astonishingly close to the stage where the former president was speaking. A video posted to social media and geolocated by the AP shows the body of a man wearing gray camouflage lying motionless on the roof of a manufacturing plant just north of the Butler Farm Show grounds, where Trump\u2019s rally was held. The roof was less than 150 meters (yards) from where Trump was speaking, a distance from which a decent marksman could reasonably hit a human-sized target. For reference, 150 meters is a distance at which U.S. Army recruits must hit a scaled human-sized silhouette to qualify with the M16 assault rifle in basic training. The AR-15, like the shooter at the Trump rally had, is the semi-automatic civilian version of the military M16. The FBI early Sunday identified the shooter as Thomas Matthew Crooks, 20, of Bethel Park, Pennsylvania. The Secret Service didn\u2019t have anybody at a late-night news conference where FBI and Pennsylvania State Police officials briefed reporters on the shooting investigation. FBI Special Agent in Charge Kevin Rojek said it was \u201csurprising\u201d that the gunman was able to fire at the stage before he was killed. Members of the Secret Service\u2019s counter sniper team and counter assault team were at the rally, according to two law enforcement officials. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren\u2019t authorized to discuss details of the investigation. The heavily-armed counter assault team, whose Secret Service code name is \u201cHawkeye,\u201d is responsible for eliminating threats so that other agents can shield and take away the person they are protecting. The counter sniper team, known by the code name \u201cHercules,\u201d uses long-range binoculars and is equipped with sniper rifles to deal with long-range threats. U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas said his department and the Secret Service are working with law enforcement to investigate the shooting. Maintaining the security of presidential candidates and their campaign events is one of the department\u2019s \u201cmost vital priorities,\u201d he said. \u201cWe condemn this violence in the strongest possible terms and commend the Secret Service for their swift action today,\u201d Mayorkas said. \u201cWe are engaged with President Biden, former President Trump and their campaigns, and are taking every possible measure to ensure their safety and security.\u201c Calls for an investigation came from all sides. James Comer, a Kentucky Republican who is the House Oversight Committee chairman, said he contacted the Service Service for a briefing and called on Director Kimberly Cheatle to appear for a hearing. Comer said his committee will send a formal invitation soon. \u201cPolitical violence in all forms is unamerican and unacceptable. There are many questions and Americans demand answers,\u201d Comer said in a statement. U.S. Rep. Ritchie Torres, a New York Democrat, called for investigating \u201csecurity failures\u201d at the rally. \u201cThe federal government must constantly learn from security failures in order to avoid repeating them, especially when those failures have implications for the nation,\u201d Torres said. Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers, a Democrat, posted on X that he and his staff are in contact with security planning coordinators ahead of the Republican National Convention set to begin Monday in Milwaukee. \u201cWe cannot be a country that accepts political violence of any kind \u2014 that is not who we are as Americans,\u201d Evers said. The FBI said it will lead the investigation into the shooting, working with the Secret Service and local and state law enforcement. Attorney General Merrick Garland said the Justice Department \u201cwill bring every available resource to bear to this investigation.\u201d \u201cMy heart is with the former President, those injured, and the family of the spectator killed in this horrific attack,\u201d Garland said in a statement. \u201cWe will not tolerate violence of any kind, and violence like this is an attack on our democracy.\u201d Associated Press writers Colleen Long and Zeke Miller in Washington contributed to this report.",

That breach was intentional. Well, that's treason, and that person goes to Guantanamo Bay,\" he said.On the other side of the political spectrum, Andzu came to Milwaukee to protest against the Republicans on Monday, but he too said he was shocked by the assassination attempt.However, the 29-year-old said he is wary that the aftermath will become \"political theater\" and a distraction against campaign issues.\"Whether it was an actual assassination attempt against the Republicans or just political theater, whatever it doesn't change the fact that people are dying, that America is collapsing,\" said Andzu, who only gave one name.Whatever their convictions, passers-by on the streets of Milwaukee agreed that the attack will play to Trump's advantage in the polls, despite his criminal conviction.\"We've just gone to another level as far as our support for Trump,\" Altherr said.\"Now there's going to be more people that are going to be supporting president Trump.\"",

The gunman did not have a criminal history reflected in Pennsylvania\u2019s public court records, and officials said they had not identified a motive. A voter-registration record showed that Crooks was registered as a Republican, though federal campaign-finance records show he donated $15 to the Progressive Turnout Project, a liberal voter turnout group, through the Democratic donation platform ActBlue in January 2021. Early on Sunday morning, law enforcement officers had closed down all roads leading toward the home of the suspect\u2019s family in Bethel Park, south of Pittsburgh and about an hour\u2019s drive from the site of the rally in Butler. Numerous relatives did not respond to messages seeking comment. Crooks was killed after he fired from \u201can elevated position\u201d outside the outdoor rally venue where Trump was speaking, according to the Secret Service. Law enforcement officials recovered an AR-15-type semiautomatic rifle near the body of a white man they believe was the gunman, according to two law enforcement officials. Crooks appears to have graduated in 2022 from Bethel Park High School, which has about 1,400 students, and received a $500 \u201cstar award\u201d that year from the National Math and Science Initiative, according to The Tribune-Review in western Pennsylvania. In an online recording of the 2022 graduation ceremony, Crooks can be seen crossing the stage to modest applause after his name is called out, a slender young man with glasses in a black graduation gown who briefly posed with a school official and accepted his diploma. \u2014\u2014\u2014 This article originally appeared in The New York Times.",
