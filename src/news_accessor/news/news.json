        "text": "SANTA FE, N.M.\u2014Alec Baldwin\u2019s trial in the shooting of a cinematographer is set to begin Tuesday with the selection of jurors who will be tasked with deciding whether the actor is guilty of involuntary manslaughter. Getting chosen to serve in a trial of such a major star accused of such a major crime would be unusual even in Los Angeles or Mr. Baldwin\u2019s hometown of New York. But it will be essentially an unheard-of experience for those who are picked as jurors in Santa Fe, New Mexico, though the state has increasingly become a hub of Hollywood production in recent years. Mr. Baldwin, 66, could get up to 18 months in prison if jurors unanimously decide he committed the felony when a revolver he was pointing at cinematographer Halyna Hutchins went off, killing her and wounding director Joel Souza during a rehearsal for the Western film \u201cRust\u201d in October 2021 at Bonanza Creek Ranch, some 18 miles (29 kilometers) from where the trial is being held. Mr. Baldwin has said the gun fired accidentally after he followed instructions to point it toward Hutchins, who was behind the camera. Unaware the gun contained a live round, Mr. Baldwin said he pulled back the hammer\u2014not the trigger\u2014and it fired. The star of \u201c30 Rock\u201d and \u201cThe Hunt for Red October\u201d made his first appearance in the courtroom on Monday, when Judge Mary Marlowe Summer, in a significant victory for the defense, ruled at a pretrial hearing that Mr. Baldwin\u2019s role as a co-producer on \u201cRust\u201d isn\u2019t relevant to the trial. The judge has said that the special circumstances of a celebrity trial shouldn\u2019t keep jury selection from moving quickly, and that opening statements should begin Wednesday. \u201cI\u2019m not worried about being able to pick a jury in one day,\u201d Judge Marlowe Summer said. \u201cI think we\u2019re going to pick a jury by the afternoon.\u201d Special prosecutor Kari Morrissey, however, was dubious that Mr. Baldwin\u2019s lawyers, with whom she has clashed in the run-up to the trial, would make that possible. \u201cIt is my guess that with this group of defense attorneys, that\u2019s not gonna happen,\u201d Ms. Morrissey said at the hearing. Mr. Baldwin attorney Alex Spiro replied, \u201cI\u2019ve never not picked a jury in one day. I can\u2019t imagine that this would be the first time.\u201d Dozens of prospective jurors will be brought into the courtroom for questioning Tuesday morning. Cameras that will carry the rest of the proceedings will be turned off to protect their privacy. Jurors are expected to get the case after a nine-day trial. Attorneys will be able to request they be dismissed for conflicts or other causes. The defense under state law can dismiss up to five jurors without giving a reason, the prosecution three. More challenges will be allowed when four expected alternates are chosen. Before Judge Marlowe Sommer\u2019s ruling Monday, prosecutors had hoped to highlight Mr. Baldwin\u2019s safety obligations on the set as co-producer to bolster an alternative theory of guilt beyond his alleged negligent use of a firearm. They aimed to link Mr. Baldwin\u2019s behavior to \u201ctotal disregard or indifference for the safety of others\u201d under the involuntary manslaughter law. But the prosecution managed other wins on Monday. They successfully argued for the exclusion of summary findings from a state workplace safety investigation that placed much of the blame on the film\u2019s assistant director, shifting fault away from Mr. Baldwin. And the judge ruled that they could show graphic images from Hutchins\u2019 autopsy, and from police lapel cameras during the treatment of her injuries.",

        "text": "WASHINGTON -- Leaders of NATO countries will open their annual summit on July 9 in Washington to discuss ways to bolster the alliance's defense capabilities and support Ukraine against the backdrop of political uncertainty in the host country and Russia's intense bombing of Ukraine. NATO is expected to announce plans for European members to boost spending on weapons and ammunition procurement following years of underinvestment as well as a 40 billion-euro ($43 billion) aid package for Ukraine. The agenda of the three-day summit, which will mark NATO's 75th anniversary, will be partially overshadowed by concerns about U.S. President Joe Biden's age and ability to lead after his chances of winning reelection this November took a hit following his dismal debate performance against Republican contender Donald Trump last month. Support and aid to Ukraine is likely to take on even greater immediacy at the summit following one of the worst Russian air attacks on the country since the Kremlin launched the full-scale invasion in February 2022. The barrage of missiles fired across Ukraine on July 8 struck several civilian facilities, including Kyiv's Okhmatdyt Children's Hospital, killing at least 41 people in total and injuring scores more in what Biden called a \"horrific reminder of Russia's brutality.\" Michael Carpenter, senior director for NATO at the National Security Council, told reporters on July 8 that the allies will announce new measures to bolster Ukraine's security, including air defense and F-16 fighter jets, but he did not give any details. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has for months pleaded with NATO members for more air defense, especially the U.S.-made Patriot missile system, to defend its troops, cities, and infrastructure against large-scale Russian bombing campaigns. The alliance will also announce a new NATO military command in Germany to coordinate the training and equipping of Ukrainian troops and station a senior NATO representative in Kyiv. However, the summit will not extend an invitation for Ukraine to join the alliance. Carpenter said there was still no consensus on the issue among the 32 allies. The NATO communique is expected to say that Ukraine belongs in the alliance without giving a time frame for when it will join. NATO members also couldn't agree on a multiyear military aid package for Ukraine that outgoing Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg had proposed. Instead, NATO will announce a one-year, 40 billion-euro package. Biden and Zelenskiy will meet on July 11 and be joined by the leaders of about two dozen other countries that have signed bilateral security agreements with Ukraine. Biden last month signed a 10-year agreement that calls on the United States, among other things, to help bolster Ukraine's military-industrial complex through co-production and joint ventures with U.S. industry. The expected announcements have disappointed some Western supporters of Ukraine who want greater aid and a clearer path into NATO. \"I don't see this summit doing much for Ukraine at all,\" Kurt Volker, who served as U.S. ambassador to NATO in 2008-09 and former special envoy to Ukraine in 2017-19, told the Center for a New American Security earlier this month. But Carpenter said the commitments made to Ukraine during the summit will show that Russian President Vladimir Putin's strategy of outlasting the alliance won't work. NATO unity on Ukraine, however, will be challenged at the summit by Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, whose pro-Russian views have irked the alliance. Orban, who just took over the rotating presidency of the EU, flew to Moscow last week without informing the bloc ahead of time to discuss an end to the war with Putin. The trip was denounced by Zelenskiy, the EU, and the Biden administration. NATO Spending Defense spending by NATO members will be another hot topic at the summit. NATO members committed a decade ago to reach a defense spending target of at least 2 percent of gross national product by 2024. Stoltenberg said that 23 of the alliance's 32 members will meet that target this year. \"One of the things you'll see at the summit, certainly behind closed doors, is that there'll be a lot of allies holding each other's feet to the fire in terms of defense spending commitments,\" Carpenter said. U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson (Republican-Louisiana), a Trump ally, said on July 8 that Republicans \"celebrate the peace and stability that NATO has secured...but we also believe that NATO needs to be doing more.\" Some Western officials say 2 percent should be a floor, not a ceiling, and that NATO members should be spending 2.5 percent or more amid growing threats from Russia, China, and Iran. \"If we look into the future, and we look into fully resourcing our defense plans and preparing for all possible contingency, this will require for a number of countries to go beyond 2 percent,\" Benedetta Berti, head of policy planning in the office of the NATO secretary-general. Johnson, who spoke at the Hudson Institute, a Washington think tank, said Republicans were pushing for a \"self-reliant European defense industrial base.\" Trump harangued NATO allies when he was president for not meeting their spending commitments, threatening at one point to withdraw the United States from the alliance. Biden's poor debate performance and the specter of another Trump presidency has many European allies worried. But National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said the White House had not picked up any signed from allies that they need to \"be reassured of American leadership and President Biden's commitments.\" Strengthening ties with Asian partners to contain China will be another topic at the summit. NATO allies will be joined by the leaders of four Asian countries, including Japan, South Korea, Australia, and New Zealand. NATO members have criticized China for supplying Russia with electronics used in weapons production. \"The global threats and challenges we face, including from authoritarian actors and terrorist organizations, are all inextricably linked,\" Carpenter said. For Stoltenberg, the summit is expected to be his last major event before he departs the alliance on October 1. He will be replaced by Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte.

        "text": "An American climber's mummified remains have been found 22 years after he vanished in Peru. On Monday, July 8, the Peruvian National Police released a handout picture showing officers evacuating 59-year-old William Stampfl's body from a mountain in the Ancash region, around 270 miles north of the capital Lima. Police confirmed the climber's clothes were in good condition. Per the AFP, police said the hiker's \"remains were finally exposed by ice melt on the Cordillera Blanca range of the Andes\" more than two decades after he was reported missing in June 2002. The news agency stated that Stampfl vanished after an avalanche hit his group on Mount Huascar\u00e1n, which stands at over 22,000 feet high and is the highest peak in Peru. According to CBS News, the climber's body, including his harness, and boots, were all well-preserved when he was discovered. Peruvian police identified Stampfl by his passport, which was found at the scene, per AFP. The Peruvian authorities didn't immediately respond when contacted by PEOPLE. In November 2023, Peruvian scientists told the Associated Press that the country had lost over half its glacier surface in the past 60 years as average temperatures around the world increased. \u201cIn 58 years, 56.22% of the glacial coverage recorded in 1962 has been lost,\u201d glaciology expert Mayra Mej\u00eda, who is an official with Peru\u2019s National Institute of Research of Mountain Glaciers and Ecosystems (Inaigem), said, per the outlet. Mej\u00eda told the news agency that glaciers had almost disappeared within some of the country's mountain ranges. The discovery of Stampfl's remains comes after a climber named Marta Emilia Altamirano's body was found attached to a glacier in February 2023, nearly 42 years after she suffered an accident while on an expedition in the Andes.

Per The Independent, Altamirano, also known as Patty, died at age 20 in March 1981 after she slipped at around 16,000 feet high before she fell to her death. The outlet stated her sister Corina, who was also on the climb, confirmed the news at the time, but authorities struggled to find Altamirano's remains over the years.",

India\u2019s foreign ministry last month demanded a \u201cverified stop\u201d on the recruitment of its citizens allegedly \u201cmisled\u201d into serving in the Russian army after two Indians were killed fighting in Ukraine. Two Indian nationals had been killed in March as well. Mr Modi brought up the matter during a private dinner hosted by Mr Putin on Monday, news agency PTI reported, citing unnamed sources. The Indian leader is on a two-day visit to Moscow. Russia was expected to formally announce the decision to discharge all Indians from its military following official talks on Tuesday. India had asked Moscow to quickly discharge all Indians working in its military and ensure their safe return while urging its citizens to \u201cexercise caution\u201d in seeking employment in Russia. Randhir Jaiswal, India\u2019s foreign ministry spokesperson, said about 20 people had sought help to return home. Nearly 100 Indian citizens have reportedly been recruited in the Russian military, many of them conned by agents into working as \u201carmy security helpers\u201d, according to a report in The Hindu. A group of men from the western states of Punjab and Haryana dressed in army uniforms recorded a video earlier this year claiming they had been tricked into fighting in the Ukraine war. In May, Indian police arrested four people allegedly linked to an international human trafficking ring involved in tricking workers into fighting in the Ukraine war by offering them lucrative jobs. Mr Modi, making his first bilateral visit to Russia since starting his third time as prime minister, was welcomed by Mr Putin on Monday night. \u201cI look forward to tomorrow\u2019s negotiations which will undoubtedly further strengthen the friendship between India and Russia,\u201d Mr Modi wrote on Twitter/X. The Russian leader showed Mr Modi around his residence outside Moscow on a golf cart ahead of official talks in the Kremlin. \u201cIndia\u2019s relationship with Russia is based on mutual trust and respect,\u201d Mr Modi said while addressing the Indian diaspora in Moscow on Tuesday.",

        "text": "Move over, New York and Paris, Berlin Fashion Week is quickly becoming a place for young designers to see and be seen. Berlin has been doing its thing since 2007. But this year, the German capital showed love to Black designers on July 2 and 3 with Black in Fashion, a pop-up event dedicated to providing a platform for designers of African descent.

        "text": "Zo\u00eb Kravitz spent years working on the script for her directorial debut, and while the story went through many changes during development, the title always remained the same: Pussy Island. But now that the thriller is about to debut in theaters, it's under the new, less provocative title, Blink Twice. Kravitz previously made it clear that she was dedicated to keeping the title Pussy Island, but she now explains to Entertainment Weekly why the name had to change despite her original plan. \"It was made very clear to me that 'p---y' is a word that we, our society, are not ready to embrace yet,\" she says. \"There were a lot of roadblocks along the way, whether it be the MPAA not wanting to put it on a poster, or a billboard, or a kiosk; movie theaters not wanting to put it on a ticket.\" But the issues went deeper than logistics. First-time director Kravitz learned throughout the process of making the movie that the target audience she was trying to reach and empower with the title Pussy Island actually had the opposite reaction. \"Interestingly enough, after researching it, women were offended by the word, and women seeing the title were saying, 'I don't want to see that movie,' which is part of the reason I wanted to try and use the word, which is trying to reclaim the word, and not make it something that we're so uncomfortable using,\" Kravitz says. \"But we're not there yet. And I think that's something I have the responsibility as a filmmaker to listen to. I care about people seeing the film, and I care about how it makes people feel.\" Blink Twice, written by Kravitz and E.T. Feigenbaum, stars Naomi Ackie as Frida, a cocktail waitress tired of being overlooked who gets invited to billionaire tech mogul Slater King's (Channing Tatum) private island for what seems like a nonstop luxurious party. But she soon finds out that paradise isn't all that it seems after her best friend Jess (Alia Shawkat) goes missing, and none of the other partying vacationers seem to care \u2014 or even remember that Jess was there despite meeting her days earlier. The dark drama soon becomes a literal fight for survival. Kravitz began writing the script with Feigenbaum in 2017, and she says she still believes in the original title, even though she had to change it. \"I do believe that Pussy Island was the first thing I wrote down when I wrote this movie, and it's the seed of the film, and the spirit of what that means to me is still alive and very much present in the film,\" she adds. \"And I love the new title. I'm happy with the new title. I think everything happens for a reason, and I think it actually really focuses the movie in a great way. And I think that was always the way it was meant to be.\" Want more movie news?

        "text": "When Alec Baldwin\u2019s manslaughter trial begins Tuesday, he\u2019ll be armed with top-gun defense lawyers, the power of his outsized celebrity and a possible scapegoat: Hannah Gutierrez-Reed, the \u201cRust\u201d armorer already serving time in a New Mexico prison for the accidental shooting death of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins. But Baldwin\u2019s path to avoiding a similar fate \u2013 Gutierrez-Reed was hauled off by deputies just minutes after her March 6 guilty verdict was read before a shocked courtroom \u2013 is precarious and narrow, legal experts have told TheWrap. Especially since Baldwin was the one holding the gun. The infamous October 2021 incident on the low-budget Western near Santa Fe netted Gutierrez-Reed\u2019s conviction, as well as a guilty plea on a misdemeanor negligence charge from assistant director David Halls. Baldwin, as the last crew member to face criminal justice for the \u201cRust\u201d disaster, also has the advantage of having seen the lion\u2019s share of the state\u2019s evidence already. And on Monday, the judge overseeing the case gave Baldwin a small legal victory when she declared that prosecutors could not present evidence of his role as co-producer. The state had intended to argue that in that position, Baldwin failed as overseer of set safety, beyond just recklessly pointing guns as an actor. But that\u2019s where Baldwin\u2019s advantages seem to run out. Never-before-seen set footage presented as evidence during the Gutierrez-Reed trial showed clip after clip of Baldwin\u2019s cavalier handling of weapons, including barking orders at his crew to hastily reload, and another where he uses a gun as a \u201cpointing stick\u201d to move cast and crew around. And the jury can also see the outcomes for Halls and Gutierrez-Reed as a foundation for the idea that this was more than just a tragic accident, legal experts say. Since the incident well over two years ago, Baldwin has been free on bail and has not shied from the spotlight. He told ABC News\u2019 George Stephanopoulos in a tearful interview just weeks later that he didn\u2019t pull the trigger, has maintained that position \u2013 and his innocence \u2013 ever since. And Baldwin and wife Hilaria, who share seven children, announced last month that they will debut a new reality series, \u201cThe Baldwins,\u201d on TLC sometime in 2025. Jury selection was slated to begin Tuesday, with the trial expected to last two weeks or more. Baldwin, expected in the courtroom daily, faces up to 18 months in jail with possible fines; he also faces multiple civil cases in California and New Mexico.",

Putin in 2022 signed a decree giving the celebration official status. \"For us, for the state, there can be nothing more important than strengthening the family,\" Putin said Monday as he met participants of a competition for Russian children.Across the border in neighboring Ukraine, Russia launched one of its deadliest attacks of the year, its troops sending a barrage of missiles to hit targets across the country, including the Okhmatdyt Children's Hospital in Kyiv. At least 38 people were killed and 190 were injured nationwide.A day of mourning is being observed in the country as a result of the attacks. Searches were still ongoing on Tuesday for survivors trapped beneath rubble at Ukraine's largest pediatrics facility.Russia denied targeting the children's hospital, saying on Monday that debris from a Ukrainian air-defense missile hit the facility. Ukraine said the Russians used a Kh-101 cruise missile to attack the site. Ukraine's Security Service said it had found wreckage from the weapon.\"The experts' conclusions are unequivocal \u2013 it was a direct strike,\" Ukraine's State Security Service said on Telegram. Newsweek has as yet been unable to verify this.Putin said in Moscow on Monday: \"If you went to this competition, a family competition, it means that you not only felt like a family team, but were also ready to work together to achieve a common goal. Nothing unites people like working together to achieve a common result.\"Putin's celebration of Russia's Family, Love, and Fidelity Day against the backdrop of the deadly attacks sparked negative reactions on social media.\"While russian missiles were flying at hospitals in Ukraine, putin spoke at the closing of the russia exhibition and promised new benefits for large families on the occasion of Family Day,\" said pro-Ukrainian X (formerly Twitter) user J\u00fcrgen Nauditt, who posts regular updates about the war.\"Putin who is known to love Ukrainian children so much that he stole thousands of them, hosted event 'promoting family values' after bombing children's hospital in [Kyiv],\" another X user wrote.In an emailed statement to Newsweek, United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker T\u00fcrk deplored Russia's missile strikes on Ukraine.\"Shockingly, one of the strikes severely damaged the intensive care, surgical and oncology wards of Okhmatdyt, which is Ukraine's largest children's referral hospital, and destroyed its children's toxicology department, where children receive dialysis,\" T\u00fcrk said. \"Among the victims were Ukraine's sickest children.\"T\u00fcrk added: \"There must be prompt, thorough and independent investigations into these latest grave attacks on civilians and civilian infrastructure, and those responsible must be held to account.\"Do you have a tip on a world news story that Newsweek should be covering?

        "text": "By Andrew Osborn MOSCOW (Reuters) - It boasts a replica of the 'Tsar Bomba', the most powerful nuclear bomb ever tested, slick presentation stands extolling the virtues of four Ukrainian regions Russia says it has annexed, and artwork lionising the Russian army in Ukraine. After organisers said over 18 million people had flocked to Moscow's \"Russia\" exhibition in eight months, making it one of the top 10 visited places on the planet, President Vladimir Putin has decreed it will become a permanent landmark. Originally conceived as a temporary Kremlin-backed project designed to fuel patriotism and promote the authorities' view of Russia's past, present and future, Putin, on his fifth visit to the exhibition on Monday, told an audience there: \"We have things to show off, we have things to be proud of, but that's not all. It's also important to present it all with talent and beauty. We need to create the conditions to show what the country is doing, how it is living, and what we need to achieve. That's why... we've agreed to set up a national centre.\" The move is emblematic of a drive by Putin to unite Russians behind him at a time of war when the Kremlin is promoting a single, strong patriotic narrative and punishing those who dissent from it. Critics have been branded \"foreign agents\" or extremists, and some have been handed long jail terms for discrediting the armed forces or spreading \"fake news\" about the war. The \"Russia\" exhibition opened its doors in the run-up to the election in March this year which handed Putin a fifth presidential term. It has since served as a venue for political and social events - discussions focused on the war or on the traditional family values Putin has championed - becoming a public forum where the ideology he espouses is promoted. Housed for the last eight months in a Soviet-era Moscow park built under Josef Stalin to showcase the USSR's achievements, it has been used by the Kremlin to stoke a feel-good sentiment as Russia is prosecutes what it calls a \"special military operation\" in Ukraine. \"I feel immense pride,\" a visitor called Margarita told Reuters. \"We (Russians) are envied for our unity, for the friendship of all our peoples, for the way we help each other. I don't have the words to express all my feelings and emotions of what I have seen and heard here.\" PERMANENT FIXTURE At Putin's behest, the exhibition - which also appears designed to persuade Russians that their country can keep developing on the home front while being at war - will be moved across the city and become a permanent museum in a complex that was previously used to host major commercial exhibitions. The sprawling installation has a soft side too, showcasing traditional Russian folk culture and cooking along with vital economic statistics and homegrown high-tech. A popular draw for school groups and heavily promoted to families, people from across Russia have travelled to the capital to take it in at a time when the authorities have told Russians they should take inspiration from what they cast as the brightest moments in their country's history to prevail in an \"existential\" struggle with the West. A presentation stand for Crimea, the Black Sea region which Russia seized and annexed from Ukraine in 2014, gives visitors the chance to have their photograph taken with glossy images of the peninsula's landmarks. It shows a sun-kissed map, declaring: \"Crimea. Here is where the motherland starts.\" The four Ukrainian regions the Kremlin says it annexed in 2022, what it calls Russia's \"new regions\" - Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia - are all given similar treatment, despite the fact that Moscow does not control any of them fully. Kyiv's political leadership says it will fight until its forces regain control of all four regions which it says were stolen from it in a brutal colonial-style war of conquest. The Moscow exhibition shows Russia is unlikely to give them back easily. Holding his small son in his arms, Andrei, a visitor from Donetsk, said he felt pride for what he was seeing and was wowed by how Russia's vast expanse, including the \"new regions\", was represented. \"I am originally from Donetsk and very happy that the new regions are fully presented,\" he said.

China has bolstered its presence in the Indian Ocean, and the two are jostling for influence in countries in the region.China has built stronger ties with Russia in the wake of the Ukraine invasion, hoping a Russian victory will damage US power and enhance its own global might. And it's this friendship Modi's seeking to drive a wedge between.\"There is a real chance of future conflicts, and India would prefer to avoid Russia exporting advanced military hardware to China,\" said Rossow.Some Indian analysts believe that China poses a greater threat to Russia than NATO in the long term and that India can exploit those differences.\"The Russia-China 'alliance' may be short-term in nature, and that historical conflicts between the two, such as over their long border and under-developed natural resources in Russia's east, will resurface and trigger renewed tensions,\" said Morrow.But for the time being, Russia's new \"no limits\" partnership has got Modi worried, and he'll likely be hoping for a swift end to the Ukraine war. By maintaining good relations with Putin he's hoping he can contain the fallout.\"The war does not at all benefit its interests. The war also opens the door to legitimizing violations of territorial integrity, and endangers a principle that New Delhi has backed strongly,\" said Shidore.",

Roberts, 63, and Laign, 48, first met on a blind date over drinks in 2005 and tied the knot in September 2023.

If that is what you want, knock yourself out.\u201d \u201cI was stunned,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cI thought she would be like \u2018You must stay with me\u2019 and she did just the opposite with such confidence [and said], \u2018I know what you had and I know what you have now and if that\u2019s what you want\u2026\u2019 and I didn\u2019t go through with it.\u201d Never miss a story \u2014 sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.

Why do I think now that it\u2019s no drama and it's easy\u2026 why do we look at that as not being sexy or not being a true relationship?\" \u201cWe never talk about unlearning, we always talk about learning,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cSometimes you have to unlearn and I had to. I shared this with friends in a similar situation and they were like, \u2018Wow thank you.\u2019\u201d \u201cYou have to really dig deep and go, \u2018Is that what we think is love?\u2019 No,\u2019 but at the time we do.\u201d In January 2023, Roberts announced on Good Morning America that she planned to marry Laign that year. \"I'm hesitating because I haven't said it out loud yet \u2026 I'm saying 'yes' to marriage,\" Roberts said when discussing New Year's intentions on air. \"We're getting married this year.\" The two said \"I do\" in Farmington, Connecticut on Sept. 8, 2023 in front of 250 guests, then celebrated their nuptials a second time in New Orleans in December.

        "text": "Elizabeth Taylor hurt her hip. And Sharon Stone\u2018s life would never be the same. It was May 1995, and the Basic Instinct star, then 37, was at the Cannes Film Festival plugging her new movie, The Quick and the Dead, when she was approached by Dr. Mathilde Krim, founder of the American Foundation for AIDS Research. Would Stone consider standing in for the ailing Taylor as host of the charity\u2019s star-studded annual fundraiser on the Riviera? She said yes, as she had for years for any ask amfAR had of her. But years earlier, it was not an easy decision. In the late \u201980s, AIDS was a disease still shrouded in stigma and shame, even as it devastated much of the artistic community. Stone was warned that taking the gig might very well \u201cruin her career.\u201d She took it anyway and ultimately became Taylor\u2019s successor, serving as amfAR\u2019s celebrity spokesperson for the next two decades. In many ways, she was perfect for the job. Like Taylor, she was bold, glamorous and bursting with star power, exactly the sort of larger-than-life figure who could draw a crowd to a cause that desperately needed attention. Of course, over that same quarter century, Stone\u2019s fortunes in Hollywood have followed more twists and turns than a Joe Eszterhas script \u2014 a stroke in 2001 knocked her off the screen for a full seven years \u2014 but still, even today she\u2019s pretty great at drawing a crowd (albeit sometimes an angry one). Ahead of her keynote speech at THR\u2018s joint summit with the Social Impact Fund, we sat down with the 66-year-old cinematic icon for a frank and freewheeling discussion \u2014 her favorite kind \u2014 not just about her philanthropic endeavors but also about Hollywood\u2019s lingering misogyny problem, her preferred way to be kissed and why she believes it\u2019s time the industry finally forgives Kevin Spacey. So, who told you that becoming amfAR\u2019s spokesperson would ruin your career? My publicist at the time, Cindi Berger. We were thick as thieves back then. We were in Cannes and Dr. Krim and her team approached us. Cindi and I talked about it. We were on this little side street in Cannes, in the dark, and she said, \u201cIf you do this, it\u2019s going to ruin your career.\u201d And I said, \u201cI know.\u201d And she said, \u201cBut if you don\u2019t, I don\u2019t think I could ever talk to you again.\u201d Other celebrities were attaching their names to causes even back then, no? Elizabeth did, and prior to her there was Audrey Hepburn for the United Nations. But big stars [still looking to get hired for big roles] weren\u2019t doing anything for any underrepresented groups, especially a group that was stigmatized. I remember Cindi getting hives all over her neck when we talked about it in Cannes. That stigma has lessened a lot over the years. Now, AIDS medications are being sold in TV commercials. Like aspirin. So, what were the consequences back then? Did it indeed ruin your career? I didn\u2019t get roles. I couldn\u2019t get a job. People would turn me down without me even knowing it. I was up for this beautiful movie by this writer \u2014 I won\u2019t say who it was \u2014 and I never even got the script. To this day, he doesn\u2019t believe that I didn\u2019t read his script. Well, the next year, in 1996, you won a Golden Globe and got nominated for an Oscar for Casino \u2026 But I was never going to win an Oscar. Not ever. Francis Ford Coppola came to me when I was nominated and said, \u201cYou\u2019re not going to win.\u201d He was like, \u201cI want you to be prepared. I don\u2019t want you to fall apart in front of these people.\u201d You left amfAR in 2015. How come? I had a close relationship with Dr. Krim, but then she passed away and I still had to deal with Harvey Weinstein, who was involved with amfAR for 10 years. He did not sexually abuse me, but he was physically abusive. Like, he would throw me across the room, he would grab me. When I\u2019d do the amfAR auction, he would come on the stage and put his hand around my neck, then grab the microphone and try to change the bids. Dealing with him took a tremendous amount of patience from me. You\u2019ve had a lot of experience dealing with misogynists in Hollywood. Well, Hollywood is set up to be misogynistic. It\u2019s a business run by men. It\u2019s a business where men make the money. Where men write, produce and direct the projects. Where men write the parts that are played by women. And those parts are not written about real women. They\u2019re written to be the fantasy of how women should be. Then, the male critics tell you if you met the fantasy or not, if you behaved in the right way. You know, until Basic Instinct, women had to cross their legs a certain way on the screen, at the ankles. You couldn\u2019t cross your legs like a man. You weren\u2019t even allowed to show your armpits. We had to get permission for me to show my armpits in that movie. Wait a second. Paul Verhoeven infamously snuck in a shot of your bare crotch in Basic Instinct \u2014 that was OK for him to do? But he needed permission to show your armpits? That [crotch] shot wasn\u2019t even a full frame. It was only a third of one frame. It\u2019s called a squeeze frame. But the scene with the armpits, we had to deal with that. Your character in that movie \u2014 Catherine Tramell \u2014 is controversial to this day. Some critics say she\u2019s an anti-feminist monster, others hail her as a powerful icon of empowered womanhood. Which is she? I guess it depends on if she scares you or not. I would say MAGA people would probably think she\u2019s scary. And you? What did you think of her? I wanted to play her so badly that I had the script on top of my refrigerator for eight months. I just kept thinking, \u201cI\u2019m going to manifest this, I\u2019m going to get this part,\u201d as they offered it to everybody else on the planet \u2026 Yeah, many actresses turned it down \u2026 I was the 13th choice. The line producer told me that relentlessly though the entire shoot while he called me Karen. \u201cYou, Karen, were the 13th choice.\u201d And then the movie comes out and suddenly you\u2019re one of the biggest stars in the world. Which I didn\u2019t really get for quite a while, because when I did Total Recall, I had fame for like three months. But with Basic Instinct, four months went by, five months, six, and the fame wasn\u2019t going away. How did that make you feel? Did you like being famous? Yes! It felt like a relief. It was so crazy. As I walked down the carpet in Cannes and a thousand people started chanting my name, I had such a surge of relief come over me, such a feeling of calm. Relief from what? When I was little, growing up in Meadville, Pennsylvania, I had this feeling that I was going to be a movie star. This is who I was going to be. I was going to live in a house that had a spiral staircase. It was weird because I was super shy. When I read from the Bible in church, I was so shy my tears would drop on the Bible pages. I was the sort of kid who sat in my closet with a flashlight and read. But I just knew I was going to be a star. So, when it happened, I just suddenly felt like I was in my body. You grew up relatively poor, no? My dad made $14,000 a year and had four kids, and we were considered wealthy in our community because I had school shoes and play shoes. I grew up in a place with no stoplights. There were 87 people in my class. Kids drove their tractors to school after they did their chores. But you know what, I just found out that I\u2019m French royalty. I just did that show on PBS, Finding Your Roots, and it turns out I\u2019m related to Charlemagne. I am from a long line of royalty in France. We were talking about misogyny in Hollywood. Do you think the environment has improved at all? Has the #MeToo movement made any difference? I think men are men and women are women. And I think that\u2019s something we should want. I think we should want men to flirt with us. Now, these days, there are some women who don\u2019t like certain things that I still like. For instance, I don\u2019t want a man to ask me if he can kiss me, I really don\u2019t. I want him to just grab me and kiss me \u2026 But only if it\u2019s the right man, I presume. You obviously want to be able to say no. Yes, if I don\u2019t want it, I want to say, \u201cNo, thank you,\u201d and for it to stop. But if he\u2019s the right man and he throws me against the wall and kisses me \u2014 yes, please, to that. I really miss passion. I really miss sexual expression. I find this whole thing very stifling. Also, we really need to delineate between what\u2019s a misdemeanor and what\u2019s a felony. That needs to happen. There\u2019s a difference between a slap on the ass and rape. They aren\u2019t the same thing. You got into a little hot water recently for defending Kevin Spacey. People are mad at me for that. I said that after being in therapy for seven years, not being allowed to work, losing his home, losing everything, he should be allowed to come back. He\u2019s reached out to everybody he\u2019s offended and said he\u2019s sorry. Kevin grabbed people by their genitals. Many people. But nobody [has publicly said] he\u2019s raped them or forced them into a sexual encounter. But there\u2019s so much hatred for him because in his case it was man-on-man. That\u2019s why he\u2019s not allowed to come back. Because he offended men. But can I tell you how many men have grabbed my genitals in my lifetime? A lot more than Kevin Spacey has grabbed men\u2019s genitals. And none of them has ever apologized to me. Do you think you\u2019re more forgiving of canceled people because you\u2019ve so often teetered on the edge of cancellation yourself? Oh, I\u2019ve been canceled left and right. But now I\u2019m back in fashion again. All the things that I said and did in the \u201990s that were so outrageous are now in fashion. Here\u2019s the thing \u2014 I\u2019m a dark horse. I love dark horses. I don\u2019t want to be a white horse or wear a white hat. And I get that not everybody thinks I\u2019m a good person. I get that people think I\u2019m difficult. But I\u2019m the person who wants to make sure you have water to drink and wants to make sure you have books to read and somewhere to read them. Can we talk about your stroke in 2001? You were given a 1 percent chance of survival. You lost hearing in one ear. You had 23 platinum coils surgically implanted in your brain. In the middle of it all, there was the divorce from your husband at the time, Phil Bronstein \u2026 That was the good part. That was the upside. Did the stroke change the way your brain worked? Did it change how you think? Totally. One hundred percent. A Buddhist monk told me that I had been reincarnated into my same body. I had a death experience and then they brought me back. I bled into my brain for nine days, so my brain was shoved to the front of my face. It wasn\u2019t positioned in my head where it was before. And while that was happening, everything changed. My sense of smell, my sight, my touch. I couldn\u2019t read for a couple of years. Things were stretched and I was seeing color patterns. A lot of people thought I was going to die. And it took you seven years to fully recover, right? Yes, and people took advantage of me over that time. I had $18 million saved because of all my success, but when I got back into my bank account, it was all gone. My refrigerator, my phone \u2014 everything was in other people\u2019s names. You were left completely broke? I had zero money. How do you recover from that? I decided to stay present and let go. I decided not to hang onto being sick or to any bitterness or anger. If you bite into the seed of bitterness, it never leaves you. But if you hold faith, even if that faith is the size of a mustard seed, you will survive. So, I live for joy now. I live for purpose.

        "text": "Tie those togas, lace up those sandals, and get in the chariot, loser \u2014 we're going back to the arena. The first trailer for Ridley Scott's long-awaited sequel Gladiator II is providing fans the first battle-heavy glimpse at what's in store in the historical epic, which takes place in the 20-plus years since the events of the Russell Crowe-led 2000 original. It introduces Paul Mescal's grown-up Lucius, nephew of the late Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix) and the son of Lucilla (once again played by Connie Nielsen). After the events of the first film, he was sent by his mother to live on the northern coast of Africa to shield him from the corruption and violence of Rome. He grew up there, but as an adult, he finds himself thrust back into Roman life \u2014 and the arena \u2014 when forces led by General Marcus Acacius (Pedro Pascal) invade his home in Numidia and eventually take him captive. The trailer also introduces Denzel Washington's Macrinus, a very wealthy arms dealer who uses gladiators for sport, as well as the film's two main antagonists: megalomaniacal twin emperors Caracalla (Fred Hechinger) and Geta (Joseph Quinn). Legacy cast member Derek Jacobi is also reprising his role as Gracchus. May Calamawy (Moon Knight, Ramy), Lior Raz (Operation Finale), Peter Mensah (Avatar), Matt Lucas (Wonka, Bridesmaids), and more round out the cast. Scott returns once more as director, and several other artists who brought the original Gladiator to life are returning to his sequel, as well. This includes cinematographer John Mathieson, production designer Arthur Max, and costume designer Janty Yates. All the Money in the World and Napoleon scribe David Scarpa penned the screenplay, with a story by Scarpa and Peter Craig. Want more movie news?

        "text": "Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi met President Vladimir Putin in Moscow on Tuesday, seeking to deepen the relationship between the two nuclear powers at a time when NATO leaders gathered in Washington and Russia launched deadly missile attacks in Ukraine that hit a children\u2019s hospital. \u201cOur relationship is one of a particularly privileged strategic partnership,\u201d Putin told Modi, who made his first trip to Russia since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine by the Kremlin\u2019s forces in 2022. Modi has avoided condemning Russia while emphasizing a peaceful settlement. Their partnership has become more complicated, however, as Russia has moved closer to China amid international isolation of Moscow over Ukraine. Modi did not attend last week\u2019s summit in Kazakhstan of a security organization founded by Moscow and Beijing. Modi arrived in Moscow on Monday, shortly after Russian missiles struck across Ukraine, severely damaging the largest children\u2019s hospital in Kyiv and killing at least 42 people nationwide, including some children, officials said. Modi on Tuesday alluded to the bloodshed while speaking about his meeting with Putin, which included over four hours of talks. \u201cBe it war, a struggle or a terrorist attack, every person who believes in humanity, when there is loss of life, he is pained,\u201d the Indian prime minister said. \u201cWhen innocent children are killed, when we see innocent children dying, then the heart pains. And that pain is very horrible.\u201d Modi said the two leaders shared \u201cour opinions on Ukraine with an open heart and in detail. We respectfully listened to each other.\u201d Modi added that \u201ca solution is not possible on the battlefield. Between bombs, guns and bullets, a solution and peace talks cannot be successful. And we have to adopt the path of peace only through talks.\u201d Modi\u2019s trip received extensive coverage at home, including his laying a wreath at the tomb of the unknown soldier at the Kremlin wall. But coverage of Russia\u2019s deadly attack Monday in Ukraine was muted. In televised comments, Putin said \u201call issues\u201d were discussed with Modi, who visited the Russian leader at his residence near Moscow on Monday. The two shook hands and embraced as they met. At the NATO summit in Washington, Western leaders marked the military alliance\u2019s 75th anniversary and sought to reassure Ukraine of their support. While Western countries have hit Russia with sanctions, Putin pointed out that trade between Russia and India increased by 66% last year, adding that it\u2019s a key focus of Modi\u2019s trip. Modi said that because of Russia\u2019s support, \u201cwe were able to save Indian citizens from difficulties related to requirements of petrol and diesel,\u201d adding that the nations\u2019 agreements on energy \u201chelped provide market stability to the world indirectly.\u201d Russian state media reported that they would also discuss Moscow helping India build more nuclear power plants. The two countries already are collaborating on the Kudankulam nuclear power project in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu. Russia had strong ties with India during the Cold War, and New Delhi\u2019s importance as a key trading partner with Moscow has grown since the war in Ukraine. China and India are key buyers of Russian oil following sanctions imposed by the United States and its allies that shut most Western markets off to Russian exports. India now gets more than 40% of its oil imports from Russia, according to analysts. Modi last traveled to Russia in 2019, when he attended a forum in the far eastern port of Vladivostok and met with Putin. They also saw each other in September 2022 in Uzbekistan, at a summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization bloc. A confrontation in June 2020 along the disputed China-India border dramatically altered the already touchy relationship between Beijing and New Delhi as rival troops fought with rocks, clubs and fists. At least 20 Indian soldiers and four Chinese soldiers were killed. Tensions have persisted \u2014 and have seeped into how India views Russia. But Modi is expected to continue close relations with Russia, which is also a major defense supplier for India. With Moscow\u2019s arms industries mostly serving the Russian military in Ukraine, India has been diversifying its defense procurements, buying more from the U.S., Israel, France and Italy. Trade development also is important, particularly intentions to develop a maritime corridor between India\u2019s major port of Chennai and Vladivostok, the gateway to Russia\u2019s Far East. India-Russia trade has seen a sharp increase, touching close to $65 billion in the 2023-24 financial year, due to strong energy cooperation, Indian Foreign Secretary Vinay Mohan Kwatra said Friday. Russian imports touched $60 billion and exports from India $4 billion in the 2023-24 financial year. India\u2019s financial year runs from April to March. \u2014- Burrows reported from London and Pathi from New Delhi.",

        "text": "Rescue operations stretched into a second day at a major Kyiv children\u2019s hospital struck by a Russian missile, Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Tuesday, as officials raised the countrywide casualty toll to 42 dead and almost 200 injured in the previous day's intense daytime barrage that smashed into multiple cities. Zelenskyy said on the social platform X that 64 people were hospitalized in the capital, as well as 28 in Kryvyi Rih and six in Dnipro \u2014 both cities in central Ukraine. It was Russia\u2019s heaviest bombardment of Kyiv in almost four months and one of the deadliest of the war, hitting seven of the city\u2019s 10 districts. The strike on the Okhmatdyt children\u2019s hospital, which interrupted open-heart surgery and forced young cancer patients to take their treatments outdoors, drew an international outcry. RUSSIAN MISSILES HIT CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL IN KYIV AS UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT ZELENSKYY VOWS RETALIATION The 10-story hospital, which is Ukraine's largest medical facility for children, was caring for some 670 patients at the time of the attack, Okhmatdyt\u2019s Director General, Volodymyr Zhovnir, said Tuesday. The missile hit a two-story wing of the hospital. \"The building where we conducted dialysis for children with kidney failure or acute intoxication is ruined entirely,\" he told reporters, estimating the overall damage to the hospital at $2.5 million. Danielle Bell, the head of a U.N. team tracking human rights violations in Ukraine, said at least two people were killed at the hospital and some 50 people were injured, including seven children. The casualty figure would have been much higher if patients hadn't been taken to a bunker when air raid sirens first sounded, she added. Authorities were working to restore the hospital's power and water supply, Zhovnir said. Kyiv city administrators declared Tuesday an official day of mourning. Entertainment events were prohibited and flags were lowered in the capital. Russia denied responsibility for the hospital strike, insisting it doesn\u2019t attack civilian targets in Ukraine despite abundant evidence to the contrary, including Associated Press reporting. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov on Tuesday repeated that position, pointing to a Russian Defense Ministry statement that blamed a Ukrainian air defense missile for partially destroying the hospital. Bell, the head of the U.N. team, dismissed that argument. She said an assessment of video footage and findings on site indicated the hospital \"took a direct hit, rather than receiving damage due to an intercepted weapons system.\" The hospital likely was struck by a Russian Kh-101 cruise missile, Bell said. Ukrainian officials said the same. The bodies of three more people were found Tuesday under the rubble of a residential building in the Shevchenkivskyi district of Kyiv, officials said, bringing the death toll in the single building to 10. The Russian onslaught Monday came on the eve of a NATO summit in Washington where alliance countries are expected to pledge new military and economic support for Ukraine. Russian President Vladimir Putin, meanwhile, was hosting India\u2019s Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Moscow. New Delhi\u2019s importance as a key trading partner has grown since the Kremlin sent troops into Ukraine in February 2022. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Zelenskyy was deeply critical of Modi\u2019s visit, saying on X late Monday: \"It is a huge disappointment and a devastating blow to peace efforts to see the leader of the world\u2019s largest democracy hug the world\u2019s most bloody criminal in Moscow on such a day.\" Meanwhile, Russian military and regional officials said Tuesday that Ukrainian drones targeted six Russian regions overnight, in what appeared to be a bigger-than-usual aerial attack by Kyiv's forces. Russia\u2019s Defense Ministry said air defense systems in five Russian southern and western regions \"destroyed and intercepted\" a total of 38 Ukrainian drones.",

        "text": "Russia will discharge all Indians who are fighting for Moscow's forces in Ukraine following a deal between Vladimir Putin and Narendra Modi, it has been reported.India's prime minister arrived in Moscow Monday for a two-day visit\u2014his first to Russia in three years, with trade between the countries booming since the start of Putin's full-scale invasion.Indian media outlet NDTV said the leaders discussed the fate of dozens of Indian troops who claimed they were tricked into taking up a fighting role after being persuaded by agents to go to Russia on the pretext of getting high-paying jobs. Two Indian men have reportedly died in the war in Ukraine.A video went viral in March of men from the Punjab and Haryana regions wearing army uniforms in Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia Oblast and asking for help after claiming they had been tricked into fighting.NDTV said the men had gone to Russia on December 27 to celebrate the new year there. One of the men said an agent in Russia had offered to take them to Belarus, not knowing they needed a visa.When they got there, they were abandoned by the agent and picked up by the police, before being handed over to the authorities and made to sign documents \"forcing\" them to fight in the war against Ukraine, the Indian outlet reported.But NDTV said that Modi raised the issue at a private dinner hosted by Putin on Monday, according to unnamed sources, during which Moscow agreed to discharge all Indians serving in their army and facilitate their return.The outlet also reported that Indian law enforcement had carried out raids and busted a ring involved in trafficking Indians to Russia.When asked about the reported deal between the leaders, Putin's spokesman replied, \"we do not comment on this topic in any way,\" state news agency Interfax reported. Newsweek has contacted the Kremlin and the Indian foreign ministry for further comment.Refraining from imposing sanctions for Putin's aggression, India has capitalized on its \"friendly\" country status with Russia and is now only behind China in its purchases of Russian oil. Trade in other products has also increased with trade last year worth a record $65.7 billion according to India's Trade Ministry.Putin and Modi are starting new terms in office, with the Russian leader reelected for a fifth term as president in disputed elections in March. Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) won elections last month albeit with a lesser majority than predicted.Modi broke with the tradition of newly-elected Indian leaders visiting neighboring countries first, and chose Russia instead, leading analysts to conclude it was due to New Delhi's concern at Moscow's increasing dependence on Beijing.",

        "text": "Many medical students attending Johns Hopkins will be able to receive free tuition thanks to the university receiving a $1 billion financial gift from Bloomberg. On Monday, July 8, Johns Hopkins University announced that Bloomberg Philanthropies had gifted them a hefty donation of $1 billion, something they called a \"transformative\" investment. The university's news release came after the announcement was officially made in a letter from Bloomberg founder and Johns Hopkins 1964 alum, Michael Bloomberg. The sum will ensure free tuition for medical students who are from families earning less than $300,000. In addition to free tuition, students from families earning less than $175,000 will also have their living expenses covered. \u201cBloomberg Philanthropies today announced a new $1 billion gift to make medical school free at Johns Hopkins University for a majority of students, while also increasing financial aid for students at its schools of nursing, public health, and other graduate schools,\u201d the statement from Bloomberg Philanthropies read. \u201cThe high cost of medical and nursing school has kept many talented lower-income students from enrolling, graduating, or working in the fields and communities most in need.\u201d The PEOPLE Puzzler crossword is here! How quickly can you solve it? Play now! Bloomberg Philanthropies revealed that almost \u201ctwo-thirds of all students seeking an M.D. from Johns Hopkins qualify for financial aid,\u201d adding that people graduate from the university with an average student loan debt of around $104,000. Financial aid will come into practice for students this fall and is expected to bring Johns Hopkins\u2019 medical students\u2019 average student loan debt to $60,279 by 2029, while students from most American families won\u2019t pay anything at all, per the press release from Bloomberg Philanthropies.

In 2018, the organization donated $1.8 billion to Johns Hopkins to provide financial aid to undergraduate students at 82-year-old Bloomberg\u2019s alma mater, per a press release from the university.",

        "text": "\u201cOf all the horrid, hideous notes of woe,\u201d wrote my favorite English poet, Lord Byron, \u201cSadder than owl-songs or the midnight blast; Is that portentous phrase, \u2018I told you so.'\u201d Or, to put those words in the modern-day American vernacular: Nobody likes a smart-ass Monday morning quarterback. But sometimes, the words \u201cI told you so\u201d need to be said to expose those who saw all the same horrid, hideous signs of woe \u2013 but failed to speak up. The US mainstream media is currently gorging on President Biden\u2019s cognitive decline like ravenous hyenas on the freshly slain carcass of a decrepit old buffalo. In fact, since his train-wreck debate debacle, the nation\u2019s predominantly liberal-skewed, Democrat-defending journalists have competed with each other as to who can sound the most faux shocked, horrified, appalled, and furrowed-brow-uncomprehending about the physical and mental state of their President. To which I say, REALLY? THAT Biden was a surprise to you? You all had NO idea the President of the United States is now an incoherent bumbling virtual zombie who shuffles at snail pace and can barely remember what day it is? With all due respect to my esteemed media colleagues, I call bulls\u2013t. They\u2019ve all known the truth about Biden\u2019s fast-deteriorating physical condition and clear early dementia for several years, because he\u2019s been literally showing them the evidence on an almost daily basis. When he\u2019s not been face-planting on stage, tripping on the steps of Air Force One, or falling off his bike, he\u2019s been forgetting names, talking incomprehensible gibberish, spewing blatant easily provable falsehoods, and unleashing an endless outpouring of verbal gaffes, some trivial like repeatedly calling his vice-president \u201cPresident Harris,\u201d others way more serious and potentially dangerous like vowing a US military response if China invades Taiwan. And unlike those who chose to look the other way or deny what they saw and heard with their own eyes and ears \u2013 I have documented them in my weekly New York Post columns. For example, In March 2022, after Biden made a series of crazy statements surrounding Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine that had to be instantly and disingenuously walked back by frantic White House aides \u2013 including one where he said Putin mustn\u2019t be allowed to remain in power, which his people comically insisted didn\u2019t mean he thought Putin shouldn\u2019t stay in power, or regime change in Russia \u2013 I wrote: \u201cJoe Biden is showing increasingly worrying signs of age-related cognitive decline. That\u2019s a big problem for America, and the world, at such a critical time. As is the pathetic way that Democrats and much of the mainstream media keep trying to excuse his dreadful gaffes and talk up his supposedly commanding leadership. They\u2019re so desperate to portray him as the calm, smart, wise, fact-driven antidote to his predecessor Donald Trump that they can\u2019t see the shambolic trainwreck right in front of their eyes. Or they see it but choose to ignore it.\u201d See, I told you so. And that was over two years ago. Things have got increasingly worse since then. In July 2022, while speaking about the Supreme Court\u2019s historic overturning of Roe vs Wade, Biden read out a prompt line from staffers: \u201cEnd of quote, repeat the line.\u201d As I wrote then: \u201cIt may be time to invoke the 25th Amendment on ailing, failing Biden if he deteriorates further.\u201d He even started forgetting people had died. In September 2022, he asked during another speech, \u201cJackie, are you here? Where\u2019s Jackie?\u201d as he searched the room for Jackie Walorski, an Indiana congresswoman who had been killed in a car accident the month before, and about whom he had issued a heartfelt statement of condolence to her family saying how shocked and saddened that he was by her death. In June 2023, two months after he announced he was running again for president, he ended a speech about gun control with the words: \u201cGod save the Queen, man.\u201d But Queen Elizabeth II had passed nine months earlier, and he\u2019d attended her funeral. I wrote then: \u201cPresident Biden is showing more and more signs of deteriorating cognitive and physical decline that isn\u2019t just to do with his age. I know 90-year-olds who are twice as lucid and mobile as he is. No, the cold, hard, brutal reality is that Biden\u2019s losing it, and he\u2019s losing it while also trying to be President of the United States and de facto leader of the free world \u2013 one of the most relentlessly difficult, energy-sapping, and pressurized jobs imaginable.\u2019 That was a year ago, yet still most of the media pretended Joe Biden was still in full charge of his faculties. Nothing to see here, move along, focus on criminal Trump! In September 2023, after a barrage of more cringe-worthy incidents and mishaps, including his claim to have been at Ground Zero the day after 9/11, when he didn\u2019t go there until nine days after, I wrote: \u201cThis guy is still running the world\u2019s No.1 superpower when he looks barely fit, either physically or cognitively, to run a bath. I honestly look at Biden now and genuinely wonder if he knows what day it is, let alone what he\u2019s supposed to be doing. The sad, unnerving reality is that every time President Biden appears in public now, everyone \u2013 including his own White House staff \u2013 holds their breath to see what verbal mistake he\u2019ll make, what vital US policy he might suddenly and dangerously rewrite, what indecipherable word salad he\u2019ll spew, or just whether he can manage to stay on his own two feet.\u201d That was 10 months ago! Since then, he\u2019s persisted in saying his war hero son Beau died serving his country in Iraq when, as everyone knows, he very sadly died from brain cancer in the US and he preposterously claimed his uncle was shot down and possibly eaten by cannibals in Papua New Guinea when there is no evidence for either claim. But to be fair to Biden, it\u2019s hard to know if he was lying or genuinely delusional. In December 2023, he responded to a reporter shouting, \u201cMr President, why are you losing to Trump in the polls?\u201d by saying: \u201cYou\u2019re reading the wrong polls!\u201d One second later, there was a loud bang as a random vehicle smashed accidentally into his presidential motorcade. I wrote: \u201cBiden\u2019s presidency has become a slow-moving car crash. What\u2019s inexplicable is why the Democrats seem so hell-bent on standing by a leader who\u2019s become not just a national but a global joke.\u201d That was six months ago. In January 2024, after he embarrassingly struggled to say \u201cAmerica,\u201d blathering, \u201cDon\u2019t mess with uhhiminauhwemerica,\u201d I wrote: \u201cUltimately, and most damningly, all roads lead back to his advanced age and apparent senility. When you can\u2019t even pronounce the name of the country you\u2019re supposed to be leading, it\u2019s time to go.\u201d And last month, when Barack Obama had to lead him by hand off a stage at a fundraiser in LA, I wrote: \u201cThe Obama/Biden arm-grab wasn\u2019t just a senior moment, it was the moment everyone realized the President\u2019s not fit for office. This is a once very eloquent, fast-talking, firebrand senator who can now barely speak without talking gibberish, nor walk quicker than a snail on Mogadon, and who keeps falling over or forgetting what he\u2019s supposed to be doing or saying.\u201d Then came the debate, and all the supine fawning journalists who\u2019d bent over so far backwards to stop the American people from knowing the truth about their president that I\u2019m only surprised they didn\u2019t all suffer broken vertebrae, suddenly found their eyes, ears and voices. So yes, I told you so. As did others. For years. And for telling the truth, we were branded liars, and scaremongers, and partisan pro-Republican hacks trying to distract from the real story \u2013 Trump. Now those who screamed loudest about Biden being fit and well for office are the same ones screaming the loudest about why he must quit the 2024 race because he\u2019s unwell and unfit for office. This is not because they give a damn about his health or want to finally be honest about it with the American people, but because they\u2019ve belatedly realized that he can\u2019t beat Donald Trump. It\u2019s been a repulsive conspiracy of collusion, and to borrow the prose of Lord Byron, their crocodile tears are \u201chorrid and hideous.\u201d",

        "text": "Tesla's self-driving cars seem like a marvel of machine learning. But in reality, the company relies on a small army of human \"data annotators\" who continuously improve how the cars drive by reviewing camera footage from thousands of Tesla drivers and teaching the vehicle how to behave like a human driver, like deciding when it's appropriate to use a blinker or identifying a construction cone.Business Insider has learned that those annotators focus their efforts on two high-profile categories of drivers: Tesla CEO Elon Musk and a select set of \"VIP\" drivers.BI spoke with over a dozen current and former Tesla employees, all but one who spoke on condition of anonymity, who said images and video clips from Musk's Teslas received meticulous scrutiny, while data from high-profile drivers like YouTubers received \"VIP\" treatment in identifying and addressing issues with the Full Self-Driving software. The result is that Tesla's Autopilot and FSD software may better navigate routes taken by Musk and other high-profile drivers, making their rides smoother and more straightforward.That means, experts say, Tesla's resources are being unevenly distributed and could serve as a distraction toward the company's larger mission of truly autonomous driving.Each Tesla is equipped with nine cameras, and owners can opt to share video from those cameras to improve Tesla's systems.Tesla's legion of data annotators review the clips shared with Tesla and use the images to train the system to execute a proper left turn or identify a stop sign (and stop at it). The workers also review situations where the system failed to respond properly and a driver had to take back control of the vehicle.The annotators label videos where the system worked properly and instances when it malfunctioned. By ID'ing issues, the data-annotation team can update Tesla's global database with new information to clear up any confusion for other Teslas that encounter the same situations. Put simply, they teach Tesla's AI that the stop sign at First and Main is part of a four-way stop.Analyzing data from Musk's vehicles has been a priority since the program's inception, multiple workers said.Eight workers said they recalled labeling data that they believed was associated with the billionaire. Two workers said they labeled a route in 2021 that went in and out of the driveway of a mansion in Hillsborough, California, that they later discovered belonged to Musk. The Tesla CEO sold the house in November 2021 for $32 million.Several workers said they spent a significant amount of time labeling routes in and out of Tesla's Austin and Fremont, California, factories, as well as the SpaceX office in Hawthorne, California.While the annotators could have been viewing data from other Tesla employees or SpaceX workers who owned Teslas, they said the same focus was not given to other factory or office parking lots in California or elsewhere. In addition, one recalled labeling a series of clips from late 2022 and early 2023 that involved Twitter's headquarters in San Francisco. The worker said the team was told to focus on data from areas near Twitter headquarters during the same time period that Musk took control of the social-media company.John Bernal, a former Autopilot analyst and test driver, and three other former workers told BI they were informed they were working on data from Musk's car and specifically told to treat the clips with care. While workers at the data-labeling plants are typically rated on how fast they can annotate the data, Bernal and two other workers said they were told to take more time with data from Musk's vehicles, adding that the clips would go through an extra round of quality assurance as well.\"It seems pretty clear that Elon's experience would be better than anyone else's,\" one former employee said. \"He was seeing the software at its best.\"Another worker said they had some misgivings about the initiative.\"It seemed like we were purposely making his car better to make Autopilot look different than it was,\" another former employee said. \"It felt dishonest.\"Four other workers said they believed they'd labeled routes associated with Musk but had not been expressly told by supervisors. When annotators view the data, they can see a timestamp from when the footage was taken and the geolocation, but they're unable to view anything that explicitly identifies the specific vehicle or driver. Instead, annotators said they could rely on context clues, particularly the routes and locations the vehicle visited.Some workers said the cost of failing to label Musk's data correctly could be high. Two former workers recalled an incident where a data annotator was terminated shortly after labeling a clip they believed came from Musk's car. The worker was escorted out of Tesla's facility in Buffalo, New York, the workers said, after the data labeler failed to properly label a highway exit sign. One former worker said it was highly unusual for someone in data annotation to be fired without warning and that the employees were typically put on notice if they were not hitting their metrics.One former worker told BI they recalled labeling a route in 2020 from a house in Los Angeles to SpaceX's headquarters in Hawthorne, where the software struggled to identify the lines on the road toward an off-ramp. Tesla's Autopilot software has struggled to follow patchy lane markings in the past. In Walter Isaacson's biography on Musk, the author said that earlier on in the Autopilot program, Tesla persuaded a \"Musk fan\" at the California Department of Transportation to repaint the lines on Interstate 405 after Musk encountered issues with Autopilot as a result of the faded lane markings.However, one former worker said there was no way for any of the labelers to know with certainty whether the clip belonged to any one driver, adding that anyone who thinks they know the owner of the car would be operating on \"pure speculation.\"Representatives for Tesla and Musk did not reply when reached for comment.Musk isn't the only driver that gets special treatment.Since FSD was released in 2020, Tesla fans and critics alike have taken to social media to share videos of the technology succeeding and failing, from clips of it navigating difficult routes without human intervention to buggy videos showing the car running over toddler-sized dummies or mistaking the moon for a stop light.These videos do not go unnoticed by Tesla staff. In fact, the company created a system to prioritize data from drivers most likely to share their experience online, three current and former workers with direct knowledge of the issue told BI. These drivers are internally referred to as \"VIP\" users and their data is at times put in VIP queues, according to the workers.Data collected from VIP users, including high-profile Tesla drivers who post on YouTube, is scrutinized more heavily and more likely to be labeled, three current and former workers said. They said they'd been specifically told by leads on their teams that they were working on \"VIP data\" and had received overtime pay to work on the data ahead of FSD updates.\"We would annotate every area that car regularly drove in,\" one former worker, who said they were told by their manager they were working on \"Tesla influencer\" data, added. \"We'd home in on where they lived and label everything we could along that route.\"Bernal said that Tesla sent multiple test drivers out to routes YouTubers had driven, including routes driven by Raj Balwani and Chuck Cook, two YouTubers who often review the software.Bernal said he was one of eight or nine test drivers who went to Lombard Street to work on a solution, after Balwani, also known by his YouTube account Tesla Raj, posted a video of FSD repeatedly attempting to veer off the famously curvy road. The company eventually coded invisible barriers into the system to fix the issue specifically for Lombard Street, according to Bernal. (Bernal was terminated in 2022. He said it was the result of sharing a series of videos on his YouTube channel of his personal Tesla malfunctioning while using FSD.)Balwani told BI he'd never been contacted by any Tesla employees regarding his videos but that he saw the company's focus on online feedback as a positive sign.\"I think this just means that their teams are monitoring and are engaged in the areas that they need to be,\" Balwani said\"For most of what I've recorded and done since I've had FSD, almost everything has been solved, which is pretty incredible,\" he added.In 2022, Musk congratulated Cook on Twitter for giving Tesla a \"tough case to solve\" after the carmaker rolled out an update meant to address an issue with unprotected left turns that Cook had pointed out in his videos.Cook told BI he's very aware of Tesla's focus on his content \u2014 in fact, he said, he sees test drivers in his neighborhood on a weekly basis. The YouTuber said he'd attempted to reach out to Autopilot engineers over email and social media but that they never responded and the test drivers in his neighborhood had been very \"tight-lipped\" about their work.Cook said he sent an email in 2020 to an account for FSD beta testers asking whether Tesla was really looking at his data.\"They sent a screenshot of what my camera was seeing in my car just 30 minutes prior,\" he said.Cook feels Tesla is focused less on handpicking influencers and more on gathering the best data for training, he said.\"They know I'm not just blabbing and fanboying or overcriticizing,\" Cook said. \"I'm fair.\"One worker with knowledge of the issue said the VIP system wasn't designed to give preferential treatment but served as an additional method for Tesla to improve FSD for all drivers.YouTubers are \"going out and constantly trying to break the system,\" the worker said, adding: \"They're identifying difficulties that could be translated to other routes and calling attention to them.\"\"In a way, they're a second tier of test drivers,\" they added.But Tesla's focus on Musk and VIP users could be detrimental to the company's efforts to achieve truly autonomous driving, Missy Cummings, a former safety advisor for the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, said.\"It's going to be hard to make a self-driving car for the masses if it's only operating well around Elon's house,\" Cummings told BI.The issue comes down to whether Tesla's focus on VIP users contributes to niche improvements like the fixes to Lombard Street or ones that will benefit the entire community, Philip Koopman, a computer-engineering expert out of Carnegie Mellon University, told BI.\"I expect there is marketing pressure to make the VIP drivers look good in their videos, and it's hard to know how much of that is theater and how much is reality without Tesla disclosing the amount of safety improvements provided by each change,\" Koopman said.Tesla has come under increasing scrutiny from regulators over the self-driving software and the company's marketing of the service. In April, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's investigation into Tesla's Autopilot and Full Self-Driving linked it to hundreds of crashes and dozens of deaths, citing inadequate measures to ensure driver attention.Additionally, the US Justice Department is investigating whether Tesla committed securities or wire fraud over claims that it misled investors and consumers about its electric vehicles' self-driving capabilities.Meanwhile, Musk has repeatedly said Tesla is getting closer to its self-driving goal, including plans to unveil its Robotaxi service later this year.Musk sees Autopilot and FSD as existentially important for Tesla. Self-driving, he said in a 2022 interview, is \"really the difference between Tesla being worth a lot of money or worth basically zero.\"Do you work for Tesla or have a tip?

Hazel, their lively 3-year-old, had been showing signs for a while that she was prepared to part with her pacifier. With her third birthday approaching, they felt it was the ideal moment for her to make the transition. After researching online, Jake, an artist from St. Louis, Missouri, came across videos of people burying pacifiers in the ground as a symbolic farewell. Inspired by the idea, he decided to organize a funeral for Hazel's pacifier on May 18, the day before her birthday. Before the ceremony, Jake, 34, rushed downstairs to grab his notepad and pen. \"I grabbed a suit jacket, tied on a tie \u2014 haphazardly \u2014 and snagged the crocs by the door. That was it,\" Jake tells PEOPLE exclusively. \"It was a spontaneous five-minute thing, a let's-see-what-happens and have-fun-with-it moment,\" he adds. \"But it was truly led by Hazel. We wanted to give her the chance to do this herself and take that next step, with plenty of support at home.\" Never miss a story \u2014 sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from juicy celebrity news to compelling human interest stories. During the ceremony, Jake delivered his eulogy and mimicked some of Hazel's pacifier noises. \"Hello, everyone. We are gathered here to remember Pass 'The Pacifier' Bishop, one of the greatest pacis to have ever graced the lips of a toddler,\" Jake said in part during his speech. \"From our mouths to our hearts, paci brought a sense of peace and calm to our Hazel Jean.\" Afterwards, the family buried the pacifier in the backyard, closing the impromptu event with a salute and bagpipe music. \"I did this,\" Hazel proudly saluted. \"Our restless little girl is always on the move,\" Jake says. \"Her sitting through the pacifier funeral for as long as she did was impressive.\" The next morning, Hazel woke to find a surprise basket atop the burial site, doubling as her birthday celebration. Inside were lollipops, bath time surprises, glow sticks, Reese's cupcakes and even a rose. \"I also got a new bike!\" Hazel tells PEOPLE excitedly. \"She's been doing amazingly well since then,\" Jake continues. \"She hasn't mentioned the pacifier, hasn't had any meltdowns. She's really embraced this transition to big girlhood. It's been incredible.\" In June, Jake shared a TikTok video of the pacifier funeral, which has gone viral with over 2 million views and 6,000 comments. Jake admits he never expected it to become so big. \"Every time I open the app and see all the notifications, I'm still shocked,\" he says. \"My hand started cramping from keeping up with all the positive and loving comments. It feels really good ... we're letting kids feel emotions, be themselves.\" \"Even tough times like this don't have to be hard,\" he adds. \"They don't have to be painful memories. We can do them in any way we choose, and let these kids lead the way.\"",

Back in June 2023, \u201cCall On Me\u201d singer was struck in the face with a cell phone with resulted in some gruesome injuries. On Saturday (July 6), Bebe nearly found herself in the same predicament during her Palmesus Festival performance in Kristiansand, Norway. As Bebe entertained the crowd, a concertgoer attempted to throw an object at her. In the viral video of the incident, Bebe slammed the attendee and threatened to take legal action. \u201cIf you hit me with something on stage right now, I\u2019ll take you for everything you\u2019ve f*cking got,\u201d she said. \u201cDo not f*cking play with me right now. Out! Get the f*ck out.\u201d Now that the clip has gained traction online, supporters have begun to rally behind Bebe. \u201cAs she should. This behavior of throwing things at artists on stage needs to stop. It\u2019s very irritating,\u201d wrote one user. \u201cGood, they need to start shaming and booting these people because it\u2019s becoming a trend,\u201d penned another. \u201cFinally a celebrity that is taking action in this matter,\u201d added another. The June 2023 assailant, Nicolas Malvagna, was arrested. But reports state after completion of community service, his case could be dismissed, and the criminal charges would be sealed. Based on Bebe Rexha\u2019s onstage remarks, she doesn\u2019t want another repeat of that.",

Tabatha Sullivent was hospitalized on July 4 after the shark attacked her left leg while she was standing in shallow water, according to FOX affiliate KDFW and CBS affiliate KTVT. The Celina resident initially \"thought it was a big fish,\" but she quickly realized she was being attacked by a shark. \u201cI was going to kick it away,\u201d she recalled, per KDFW. \u201cThat\u2019s when I think it grabbed me.\u201d The shark ripped off a piece of Tabatha\u2019s left calf, according to KTVT. She then began screaming for help and attempted to get back to shore. Tabatha\u2019s husband, Cary, was also bitten twice by the shark while trying to help his wife. Other bystanders were able to help them out of the water. Now, Tabatha is recovering at McAllen Hospital, according to KDFW. She will need multiple surgeries to address her injured leg, per KTVT. \"My leg is pretty much gone,\" Tabatha told KDFW. \"[The bite] is all the way to the bone, it did not go through the bone.\" Never miss a story \u2014 sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories. Still, the Texas woman is feeling lucky to be alive. \u201cSomebody or something was definitely looking over us for sure,\" she said. Four people made contact with the shark at South Padre Island on July 4, including the two who were bitten, according to a news release from Texas\u2019 Parks and Wildlife Department. Officials indicated only two people were bitten, while two others simply \"encountered\" the animal. \u201cShark encounters of this nature are not a common occurrence in Texas,\u201d officials said in the release. \u201cWhen bites from sharks do occur, they are usually a case of mistaken identity by sharks looking for food.\u201d Those who may encounter large schools of bait near shore or see a shark in the water are asked to \u201ccalmly exit the water and wait for the predatory wildlife to pass.\u201d",

        "text": "July 8 (UPI) -- A California doctor, accused of deliberately driving his Tesla off a 250-foot cliff with his wife and two children inside, was released from jail Monday and ordered to undergo two years of mental health treatment. Dharmesh Arvind Patel, 43, was ordered into a two-year diversion program, which if he completes successfully will allow the three counts of attempted murder he is charged with to be dropped. Prosecutors criticized San Mateo County Superior Court Judge Susan Jakubowski's decision, saying an attempted murder charge should not qualify for a diversion program. \"We felt the crime was too serious, and the public danger too high,\" San Mateo County District Attorney Steve Wagstaffe argued. \"He did everything he could to kill his family and himself.\" Jakubowski ordered Patel to live at his parents' home and wear a GPS monitor while he is in treatment. He will not be allowed to see his wife and children -- who survived the crash -- practice medicine, drink alcohol, smoke marijuana or drive. \"He wants to continue psychiatric treatment,\" Jakubowski said last month. \"The court believes he now realized the importance of being forthright.\" Patel is accused of driving his family off a cliff, called \"Devil's Slide,\" along California's Pacific Coast Highway north of Half Moon Bay on Jan. 2, 2023. The radiologist, his wife and children survived the drop and had to be cut out of the demolished Tesla. Patel's wife told officers, \"He said he was going to drive off the cliff. He drove off on purpose,\" according to court documents. Witnesses and surveillance footage show the Tesla driving off the road without braking. Patel pleaded \"not guilty\" to three counts of attempted murder, claiming the Tesla had been experiencing tire issues before the crash. According to court testimony, psychologists testified that Patel tried to kill his two children -- ages 4 and 7 at the time of the crash -- because they could be forced into sex trafficking by kidnappers associated with Jeffrey Epstein. \"Mental health diversion is good for a bunch of defenses,\" Wagstaffe said, \"but we didn't feel it was good for this.\" Before his release Monday, Patel had been held without bail since the crash.",

On Monday, July 8, Scarlett Johansson and Channing Tatum stepped out at the world premiere of the movie, which hits theaters on July 12, at AMC Lincoln Square in New York City. Johansson's husband, Colin Jost, joined her to celebrate the romantic comedy. In the film, Tatum, 44, plays Cole Davis, who is entrusted with staging a fake moon landing after the White House deems NASA's historic 1969 moon landing mission too crucial to fail. Johansson, 39, stars as Kelly Jones, who is part of the marketing team helping rehab NASA's public image. To celebrate the film's release, Tatum wore a dashing, two-piece navy blue pinstripe suit with black dress shoes. Johansson wore a cropped halter top with a matching maxi skirt. The summer-inspired look was paired with sparkling, round dangle drop earrings. To complete the outfit, the actress wore a loose ponytail, soft pink blush, and rose lip. Johansson's husband, 42, opted for a more casual ensemble that consisted of a light blue button-up tee worn underneath a navy blue dress jacket, matching dress pants and white sneakers. Never miss a story \u2014 sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from juicy celebrity news to compelling human interest stories. In April, Johansson told PEOPLE more about starring in Fly Me to the Moon and filming with Tatum, whom she didn't know prior. \"Channing is such an easy-going actor, good-spirited and professional. Falling in love with him onscreen was pretty easy. He\u2019s such a likable person,\" she said. \"Kelly and Cole are such opposites. It was fun to play that dynamic with Channing.\" Aside from staring in the film, Johansson is also a producer. She described her character, Kelly, as a \"very modern woman living in a time where women were often underestimated.\" \"She uses that to her advantage and is always a few steps ahead,\" Johansson added. The PEOPLE Puzzler crossword is here! How quickly can you solve it? Play now! Director Greg Berlanti, who also directed Love, Simon, spoke to PEOPLE about the dynamic amongst the cast. \"Scarlett and Channing had never done a film together, and I'm sure audiences will want them to do many more after this one,\" he said. \"They're each individually a dream, both personally and professionally. They have the rarest of gifts with comedy and drama.\" \"Watching them act together was like watching two great rockstars do a duet for the first time,\" Berlanti added. \"From rehearsal through the end of shooting, working with the two of them was one of the great pinch-me moments of my life.\" Fly Me to the Moon hits theaters on Friday, July 12.",

        "text": "The Bachelorette is back and one lucky guy got a kiss (and a first impression rose) from Jenn Tran on Night 1: Sam McKinney. \u201cGoing into that first night, I didn\u2019t really have a plan, but I\u2019ve seen the show a couple times and I\u2019ve seen how many people kiss. And I think that for me, a first kiss means a lot,\u201d Tran told Decider over Zoom in a pre-premiere interview. \u201cIt takes a lot for me to be affectionate with somebody and to get to that level. So I knew in the back of my head that I wasn\u2019t going to kiss anybody unless I really felt that spark and felt that connection and felt that the relationship could go to that level that night.\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t know how many people I was going to kiss, but I was happy with myself for following my gut and for really just listening to myself,\u201d the Season 21 lead continued. So who is Sam McKinney on The Bachelorette? Why did Jenn deem him worthy of her first (and only) Night 1 kiss and first impression rose? And how long does Sam M. stick around this season? We\u2019ve got answers. Here\u2019s everything to know about Sam McKinney, including his Bachelorette bio, age, hometown, Instagram account, and a recap of his first night with Jenn Tran. Who Is Sam McKinney On The Bachelorette? According to Sam M\u2019s official ABC bio, the 27-year-old contractor from Myrtle Beach, South Carolina \u201cbrightens every room with his dazzling smile.\u201d \u201cHis tattoos and muscles might look tough on the outside, but Sam M. swears he\u2019s a total softie. He\u2019s always been a relationship guy and says his \u2018ultimate dream\u2019 is to be a loving husband and father,\u201d the bio continues. \u201cSam M. has been in love before and is extremely loyal when it comes to his partner. Cheating is his No. 1 deal-breaker and is looking for a partner as loyal as he is. When Sam M. isn\u2019t working in contracting, he loves riding motorcycles, golfing, and watching Sons of Anarchy. For Sam M., this journey is all about finding his forever, so here\u2019s hoping he can find that meaningful connection with Jenn.\u201d And now, the moment you\u2019ve all been waiting for. Sam\u2019s fun facts: \u25cf Sam M. had never been to the West Coast of the U.S. before The Bachelorette.\u25cf Sam M. officiated his sister\u2019s wedding recently.\u25cf Sam M. was homeschooled while growing up. Who Got Jenn Tran\u2019s First Impression Rose On The Bachelorette? How Sam McKinney Secured The First Stem On Night 1, Sam M. walked up to Jenn and asked her to picture her life 50 years from now, waking up on a Saturday morning to him cooking breakfast and asking \u2014 with two shots in his hands \u2014 \u201cDo you know what time it is?\u201d The \u201cshot o\u2019clock\u201d reference was a smooth nod to Jenn\u2019s Bachelor Season 28 finale speech, and though Sam M. was incredibly naive to think he\u2019d be the only guy making his first impression with a shots joke, he did snag the rose, so he did something right! In his intro video, Sam said his goal in life is to find a girl he can fall in love with. He shared that he\u2019s been single for nearly a year and was dating and engaged to a girl he\u2019d known since middle school, who cheated on him. He felt there was no repairing that relationship, but despite the heartbreak, he says his dream is to be a husband and father (to human babies and dogs). He also shared that he was in a motorcycle accident that should have killed him, but he walked away without a scratch. Thus, he tries to make the most of every opportunity he gets \u2014 like The Bachelorette! After Sam walked into the mansion, Jenn called him \u201ca hottie\u201d with \u201ca lot of Southern charm.\u201d She revealed that she always wanted to date a cowboy and excitedly dubbed Sam \u201ca sexy cowboy,\u201d but we\u2019d be remiss not to mention something else Jenn told Decider\u2026 In our pre-premiere interview, Jenn revealed that her celebrity crushes are Shawn Mendes and Chris Evans, and considering Sam M. is probably the most Evans-coded guy in this cast of 25 men, this first impression rose tracks! Someone in the mansion even told him, \u201cYou look like you should be in Top Gun 3!\u201d For those who need a refresher, Sam was the first one to steal Jenn for a second after her Night 1 welcome toast, and the two bonded over their desire for a \u201cferocious\u201d and \u201creckless\u201d love. Jenn told cameras she felt like there was an \u201cundeniable connection\u201d between the two, and later on in the evening she took Sam aside with first impression rose in hand. \u201cI feel like there has been something there, and I can\u2019t stop thinking about you all night,\u201d she explained. \u201cI don\u2019t always pick the right men, but there\u2019s something in my gut that\u2019s just telling me there\u2019s something here. I\u2019m really excited about it and really excited to get to know you more. I can\u2019t stop thinking about you.\u201d When Sam accepted the first impression rose, Jenn gave him the first (and only!) kiss of the night. She described their make-out sesh as \u201cferal\u201d and told cameras \u201che\u2019s got this energy that I am digging!\u201d So we\u2019ll have to see where the journey takes them.

And we\u2019re all just trying to be ourselves,\u201d Tran told Decider during a pre-premiere Zoom interview. \u201cI really hope that people are able to open up their minds a little bit more.\u201d During Tran\u2019s two-hour premiere on Monday, July 8, the 26-year-old from Boston welcomed 25 guys to the new Bachelor mansion, endured some truly cheesy limo exits, had some scintillating cocktail party conversations, handed out her first impression rose, and said goodbye to seven contestants before making a major announcement. We also got a dramatic sneak peek at the conclusion to Tran\u2019s season, which showed her standing in front of a man saying \u201cI can\u2019t let you propose to me\u201d before putting down her rose and walking away. When asked to tease her unique ending, Tran told Decider, \u201cIt\u2019s a surprise for sure. It\u2019s definitely not something that I could have imagined was going to happen. But I\u2019m very happy with the way everything panned out through the journey. And I\u2019m very excited for it all to come to light.\u201d Ultimately, Tran said Season 21 has \u201ca lot of twists and turns\u201d and she admitted she was \u201cconstantly surprised\u201d and \u201con the edge of my seat a lot of the time.\u201d Before we can end the journey, however, we have to begin. So let\u2019s dive right into The Bachelorette Season 21, shall we? Wondering how Jenn Tran\u2019s Bachelorette premiere played out? Who went home Night 1? Who got the first impression rose? And what Tran had to say about her first official night on Bachelorette duty or the season to come? Decider\u2019s Bachelorette Season 21 premiere recap has you covered. Can You Feel The Jenn-ergy? Tran welcomed Bachelor Nation to Boston in her Bachelorette intro video, which included footage of her playing basketball, lacrosse, tennis, and even chatting with colleagues at Tufts Medical Center, where she\u2019s working as a physician assistant student. (When she\u2019s not on the show, of course!) Before welcoming her group of guys, Tran took a moment to reflect on her ex, Joey Graziadei, saying, \u201cI\u2019ve been waiting my whole life to find my true love, and I thought that I found that with Joey. He\u2019s one of the best guys I\u2019ve ever dated. He was really there for me and really listened to me\u2026 When I came back from Joey\u2019s season, I was heartbroken, but coming home to see my family felt so good. The Season 21 lead took time to shoutout her family, especially her mom, who immigrated to America from Vietnam to give her a better future. Tran also took a moment to acknowledge that a lot of responsibility comes with being the first Asian American Bachelorette, saying, \u201cI want to be able to make everybody proud and make my heritage proud. I think what it really comes down to is just that I have to be myself and do the best that I can do. I know what I have to offer. I know who I am. And I know I\u2019m going to find my person.\u201d Jenn Tran\u2019s 25 Jenn-tlemen Arrive \u2014 Just In Time For Shot O\u2019Clock Speaking of Tran\u2019s person, it\u2019s time for her to meet the 25 Jenn-tlemen who showed up to the new mansion, Hummingbird Nest Ranch, in Season 21\u2019s premiere. First out of the limo? Marcus, a 31-year-old Army Ranger Veteran from Raleigh, North Carolina. He told Trann about his three big dreams: to serve country, go to outer space, and meet his person. He left a smooth, promising first impression and kicked off the season with some genuinely good vibes, but as the night went on, the limo exits grew increasingly chaotic. Some standout Jenn-tlemen included Thomas N, a 31-year-old retirement advisor from a big Vietnamese family, who made Tran a friendship bracelet with his last name on it; Dylan, a 24-year-old medical student whose grandmother\u2019s breast cancer diagnosis inspired his career path; Aaron Erb, twin brother of Noah Erb, who seemed to be here for the right reasons; and Devin, a 28-year-old freight company owner from Texas who Tran said was \u201cgiving a Pete Davidson vibe.\u201d (When asked if Davidson was a celebrity crush, the Season 21 lead told Decider: \u201cI think if I had met Pete Davidson in person, I probably would have a crush on him. But no, my celebrity crushes are definitely Shawn Mendes and definitely Chris Evans, for sure.\u201d) There was the \u201cshot o\u2019clock\u201d crowd, who incorporated Tran\u2019s Season 21 motto into their intros. (Tran also told Decider, \u201cI will be taking a shot every Monday.\u201d So feel free to join her.) And then, there were what I deemed the flops, the try-too-hards, and the cringe limo exits. Among them were Brendan, who bit two hot peppers to prove some sort of point but just ended up looking ridiculous; Jeremy, who rolled up in a red sports car then told Tran he had a really big penis (ugh!); Sam N, who kept talking about being a \u201clove virgin\u201d; and more. There was also Jonathon, a 27-year-old creative director who rolled in on a stretcher wearing a hospital gown (with his bare cheeks out) and a face wrap. Why? Because he was \u201clovesick.\u201d \u201cThroughout the night I really was like, \u2018That was an interesting choice!\u2019 Definitely wouldn\u2019t have been my choice! But to each their own,\u201d Tran told Decider. \u201cI always preach: Just be who you are, and if that\u2019s who you are, then OK! Better to know now than later.\u201d Amazing point! Cocktail Convos And An Attempted Car Theft After meet-and-greets, Tran headed inside and made a traditional toast, explaining, \u201cGrowing up I never really had a good role model of what love was, but through a lot of trial and error and a lot of toxic relationships, I really figured out my worth. I hope you guys are here for something serious; for a ferocious love\u2026I\u2019m not perfect. I don\u2019t expect you to be perfect. We\u2019re just gonna have some fun with it.\u201d First to steal Tran for a second was Sam M., a 27-year-old contractor from Myrtle Beach, South Carolina who turned on the Southern Charm when he stepped out of the limo (and most closely resemble\u2019s Tran\u2019s celeb crush Chris Evans out of the Season 21 cast). After their chat, Tran told cameras she felt like they had an \u201cundeniable connection\u201d and went on to chat with the rest of the competition. She bonded over her Vietnamese culture and immigrant parents with Thomas N, talked about having single moms and biting toes with Pete Devin-son, learned why Sam N. has \u201cNever Been To Third Base Emotionally,\u201d and finally unwrapped Jonathon\u2019s facial dressings to reveal a refreshingly sweet smile. After a game of truth or dare (which involved one contestant streaking through the mansion), however, an attempted car theft occurred. Yeah, you heard me! Apparently that\u2019s what happens when you try to flex with a bright red rented ride. As Jeremy was chatting with Tran in his impressive whip, Brian swiped his key inside and interrupted their one-on-one time, putting everyone in a deeply awkward position until Jeremy admitted defeat, left Brian and Tran in his own car, and sulked back to the mansion. \u201cThat\u2019s so funny \u2014 the attempted car theft,\u201d Tran laughed during her interview with Decider. \u201cI was just really confused about what was going on and I was just going with it. I was like, \u2018I\u2019ll let these boys battle it out. They can figure it out. I\u2019m not their mom.\u2019 I\u2019m not going to tell anyone what to do ever. I just sat there and waited until somebody made a decision.\u201d Who Got Jenn Tran\u2019s First Impression Rose? Later in the evening, Tran made a decision of her own and gave the first impression rose to Sam McKinney, who had admittedly been on her mind all night. \u201cI don\u2019t always pick the right men but there\u2019s something in my gut that\u2019s just telling me there\u2019s something here,\u201d Tran told Sam. M. \u201cI\u2019m really excited about it and really excited to get to know you more. I can\u2019t stop thinking about you.\u201d After Sam accepted the rose, Tran gave him her first (and only) kiss of the night, which she hilariously described as \u201cferal.\u201d Want to know more about Sam M? Be sure to read Decider\u2019s in-depth contestant explainer, which includes Sam\u2019s bio, Instagram account, a recap of his first night on the show, and insight into his remaining time on the season. Who Went Home On The Bachelorette Season 21 Premiere? Week 1 Rose Ceremony Recap So who got the rest of Tran\u2019s Night 1 roses? And which men went home early in the journey?

        "text": "The clock struck shot o\u2019clock on Monday, July 8, which meant Jenn Tran\u2019s season of The Bachelorette officially began. The season 21 premiere opened by teasing Jenn\u2019s proposal day, in which she told an unidentified suitor, \u201cI can\u2019t let you propose to me.\u201d But back at Hummingbird Nest Ranch, Jenn, 26, kicked off her season with excitement about meeting her soulmate. \u201cI\u2019m so ready to find love and I can\u2019t wait to start my journey as The Bachelorette,\u201d she told the cameras. Army ranger veteran Marcus, 31, stepped out of the limo first and told Jenn that he wanted to serve his country, go to space and find his person. And since some of those things already happened for him, Marcus hoped true love awaited him. Luxury event planner Marvin, 28, wowed Jenn next by speaking French. \u201cMarvin is tall, tall and hot, hot,\u201d Jenn told the cameras. \u201cI like Marvin.\u201d Entrepreneur Sam N. told Jenn he deemed himself \u201ca love virgin\u201d because, at 25, he\u2019d never been in love. Day trader Grant, 30, beatboxed out of the limo, and then contractor Sam M., 27, told Jenn, \u201cIt\u2019s shot o\u2019clock,\u201d referring to her now-signature phrase. \u201cSam M. is a hottie,\u201d Jenn said in an on-camera interview. \u201cHe\u2019s got a lot of southern charm.\u201d Later, aesthetics consultant Brian, 33, and insurance executive Matt, 27, also brought their own types of shots. Real estate broker Brendan, 30, tried to prove to Jenn that he could handle the heat by taking a bite of a hot pepper, while sommelier Dakota, 27, popped a bottle of champagne. Tomas A. won Jenn over by arriving with puppies. \u201cI don\u2019t know how anyone\u2019s going to top that,\u201d she declared afterwards. Jonathan rolled up in a hospital gown and face bandages, claiming he felt lovesick. \u201cWhat\u2019s most important for me is that you get to know me for what\u2019s inside, rather than what\u2019s outside,\u201d the creative director, 27, said to Jenn. He also teased, \u201cI can be a bit cheeky,\u201d before walking into the house and exposing his bare butt. Jeremy proceeded to roll up in a sports car, but the real estate investor assured Jenn he wasn\u2019t trying to compensate for anything. \u201cIn fact, I have a really big \u2014 I know \u2014 like, a really big penis,\u201d Jeremy said. Freight company owner Devin told Jenn, \u201cIt\u2019s not every day you get to meet your future wife.\u201d Jenn decided that the 28-year-old gave her \u201ca Pete Davidson vibe.\u201d Hakeem closed out the limo arrivals by showing up with dozens of balloons tied to his back. \u201cI brought the celebration for the most beautiful Bachelorette ever,\u201d the medical device salesman, 29, said to Jenn prior to getting caught in a tree when he entered the house. COCKTAIL PARTY AND ROSE CEREMONY After meeting her 25 men, Jenn headed inside to give a toast. \u201cI hope you guys are here for something serious, here for a ferocious love,\u201d she said when addressing the group. \u201cThat\u2019s what I want. I\u2019m not perfect, I don\u2019t expect you guys to be perfect. And we\u2019re just going to have some fun with it.\u201d Sam M. grabbed Jenn first, and she decided they had an \"undeniable connection.\" Tomas initiated a game of Truth or Dare during which sales executive Austin, 29, streaked around the house and algebra teacher Moze, 25, admitted he ghosted people \u201call the time.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know about that one,\u201d Jenn said. When Jenn sat down with Jonathan, he let her unwrap his bandages. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of like unwrapping a birthday present,\u201d she said to Jonathan. After seeing his face, Jenn told the cameras, \u201cJonathan is very, very hot and he\u2019s getting me hot.\u201d Brian tried to take Jenn for a ride in Jeremy\u2019s sports car, and then Devin told Jenn he liked when a girl had her toenails painted \u2014 and asked if he could get a bite of her feet. \u201cYou\u2019ll understand that I like you when I give you a bite of my feet,\u201d she responded. Jenn ultimately gave the first impression rose to Sam M. \u201cI don\u2019t always, you know, pick the right men, but there is something in my gut that\u2019s just telling me that there\u2019s something here,\u201d Jenn said to Sam M. \u201cAnd I\u2019m really excited about it and I\u2019m really excited to get to know you a lot more.\u201d Jenn and Sam M. kissed, and the Bachelorette described the smooch as \u201cferal.\u201d At the rose ceremony, Jenn opened up by thanking her suitors. \u201cI feel like the most special girl in the world, so I seriously want to thank you from the bottom of my heart,\u201d she said. \u201cYou know, being in this position, I am going to have to make some difficult decisions, so if you do go home tonight, I am so sorry. But I want you guys to know sincerely, I thank you so much for just even being here.\u201d Jenn offered roses to Dylan, Tomas N., Spencer, Grant, Marcus, Tomas A., John M., Jeremy, Devin, Brian, Aaron, Jahaan, Hakeem, Jonathan, Austin, Marvin and Sam N., which left seven men heading home. The physician assistant student informed her remaining suitors that they\u2019d be continuing to get to know her in Australia. \u201cI do have some news that\u2019s going to change everything for you guys,\u201d Jenn said to the men. \u201cTomorrow, none of you guys are going to be here. We are doing something completely unprecedented that has never been done before. We are going to Melbourne, Australia.\u201d Never miss a story \u2014 sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from juicy celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.

        "text": "\u201cIf I could shift the idea of capitalism by a millimeter by doing something different, that would be great,\u201d Kesselman said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to be just another cog in the wheel.\u201d Having built Raw from its startup days in the 1990s, Kesselman today employs roughly 100 people in the U.S. and generates annual domestic revenue of about $120 million. That revenue figure is about a quarter of the $405.4 million in revenue reported by Raw rival and Zig-Zag rolling paper maker Turning Point Brands Inc. TPB, +2.84%. While Raw may not have the heft of Turning Point Brands, it\u2019s a relatively big name in pop culture, with support from celebrities such as Lil Wayne and Miley Cyrus. Rapper Wiz Khalifa featured the brand in his song \u201cRaw\u201d a track on the 2014 album \u201dBlacc Hollywood.\u201d Raw products are heavily used in pre-rolled joints sold at legal adult-use cannabis dispensaries around the U.S. Kesselman figures he has about 10 years before he\u2019d like to retire and move to Spain. Between now and then, he\u2019s trying to come up with a way to sell shares of Raw to the company\u2019s customer base as a partial exit from family ownership of the company. He remains reluctant to sell Raw and its parent company, HBI International, to a private-equity firm or even a strategic buyer because he fears \u201cthey\u2019ll milk it like a cow and run it into the ground.\u201d He likes to joke that he tends to avoid talking to investment bankers about merger deals or staging a traditional initial public offering \u201cbecause they\u2019re too smart and they scare me.\u201d A fear, according to Kesselman: being made to change the path and mindset of the company. So he\u2019s studying other examples of alternative IPOs. He\u2019s checked out, for example, the Green Bay Packers, the legendary National Football League team has been a publicly owned nonprofit for a century. From the archives (December 2011): The sad tale of a Green Bay Packers stockholder Spotify Technology SPOT, -0.99%, which used a direct public listing of its stock rather than an underwritten IPO, has also caught his interest as exemplifying a method of diversifying and solidifying ownership, he said. He admires the ice-cream maker Ben & Jerry\u2019s because the founders have remained active and are seemingly able to continue their innovative practices despite corporate ownership after the sale of the company to consumer-products multinational Unilever PLC ULVR, +0.44% UL, +0.61%. He also looks up to Dr. Bronner\u2019s, which has grown into a national natural-soap brand but remains a family business. Kesselman said he could envisage Raw holding annual shareholder gatherings that would resemble Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s BRK.A, -0.67% BRK.B, -0.51% yearly meet-ups in Nebraska, but for fellow enjoyers of cannabis and other smoking products. \u201cI want it to be a rolling-community IPO,\u201d he said. Philanthropy is another company value Kesselman wants to preserve at Raw, with HBI International having recently passed the $3 million donation mark with contributions to a variety of nonprofits, including the Last Prisoner Project, NORML, the Weldon Project, and causes focused on clean water and animal rescue. Kesselman continues to work on brand extensions and innovations including a music festival in the works with Wiz Khalifa on the bill for 2025; building a new \u201csecret\u201d facility in Spain; and moving the company headquarters into a former bank building, replete with vaults. He has, he said, gotten a \u201cstrong, positive response\u201d to Ethereal, a new line of thinner rolling papers, with plans to craft a \u201cking-size\u201d wide version of the papers. Other companies wouldn\u2019t bother launching a product for such a niche market, but Kesselman said it\u2019s important for Raw to serve its superloyal fan base. \u201cI understand smokers \u2014 I can make them happy, and they make me happy,\u201d Kesselman said. \u201cI don\u2019t need that big check. I don\u2019t even know how to play golf. \u201d Despite his worries over investment bankers and about Wall Street\u2019s emphasis on short-term profits, taking Raw public remains a dream. \u201cI want Raw to continue its overall priority of empathetically connecting with consumers and giving them what they want,\u201d Kesselman said. \u201cEven if doing that may impact profits in the short term, in the long term it helps distinguish the brand and [allow it to] more deeply connect and uplift people who smoke Raw papers.\u201d Read on: Raw rolling papers founder looks to further elevate cannabis name celebrated in Wiz Khalifa song",

        "text": "Fred R. Krug, a producer, director and cinematographer who worked on such nature-focused TV programs as Animal World, Mutual of Omaha\u2019s Wild Kingdom and The Magical World of Disney, has died. He was 94. Krug died June 4 of natural causes at his home in Solvang, California, his daughter, Vivian Krug-Cotton, told The Hollywood Reporter. A pioneer in wildlife TV documentaries and travel shows, the Swiss-born Krug dined with Picasso, worked with The Beatles at the Hollywood Bowl and danced with the Nicholas brothers. He also collaborated with the likes of Gypsy Rose Lee, Louis Armstrong, Cornel Wilde, Jayne Mansfield, Dana Andrews, Jean Simmons, Agnes Moorehead, Art Linkletter and Tippi Hedren. Krug\u2019s career took him to the jungles of Peru, Ecuador and Brazil; to India, Zululand, South Africa and the Serengeti in Kenya; to the high country of New Zealand; and to the mountains of Italy. Friedrich Roy Krug was born on Aug. 30, 1929, in Bern, Switzerland. He purchased his first movie camera at age 10 on layaway in a photography shop and started making short films where he lived in Basel, Switzerland. He became a photographer and writer for a local newspaper at 16, covered the entertainment and art scene in Europe and translated and wrote a German version of the Bram Stoker novel Dracula. Krug came to Los Angeles and arranged a meeting with Peter Ballbusch, a fellow Swiss native who was working at MGM as a montage director. Ballbusch helped Krug get work in Hollywood. After a stint in the U.S. Army, for whom he served in intelligence, ran a base radio station and booked celebrity entertainment, Krug returned to L.A. to resume his career in entertainment. He served as the stage manager for Jack LaLanne\u2019s fabled fitness program and was a cinematographer and film-videotape director at KCOP-TV in L.A. Krug\u2019s passion of animals, primarily large cats, led him to Bill Burrud Productions, where he worked on Animal World and Mutual of Omaha\u2019s Wild Kingdom, early primetime shows about wildlife. For The Magical World of Disney in the 1970s, he operated a camera and directed the installments \u201cThe Proud Bird From Shanghai,\u201d \u201cThe Secret of Old Glory Mine\u201d and \u201cThe Golden Dog.\u201d He contributed to such other TV projects as The American West, The World of Reptiles, The Great Apes, Adventures of the Wilderness Family and Mountain Family Robinson. And he was a camera operator on NBC\u2019s CHiPs from 1978-80. Krug was endorsed for membership into the DGA by Roy Disney and in 1987 served as a planner and picket captain of the guild\u2019s only walkout, known as the \u201cFive Minute Strike\u201d for its brevity. He also was a member of the Producers Guild. An avid private pilot, Krug was active in Rotary Clubs in Hollywood and, after his retirement, Santa Ynez. In addition to his daughter, survivors include his wife of 68 years, Rosemary, and his son-in-law, Samuel.",

        "text": "Prime Minister Narendra Modi was set to hold talks with President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday, a day after the Indian leader arrived in Moscow amid global outcry over Russian strikes in Ukraine. Modi, visiting Moscow for the first time since Russia launched its campaign in Ukraine in February 2022, will seek to nurture New Delhi's India's long-standing relationship with Moscow.At the same time, he is courting closer Western security ties after being returned to power last month as leader of the world's most populous country.\"There are no surprises in preparation. The main thing is to create an atmosphere for meaningful interaction,\" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told state TV when asked about the talks.Modi landed in Moscow hours after Russia launched a massive barrage targeting cities across Ukraine Monday that killed more than three dozen people and heavily damaged a children's hospital in Kyiv, sparking condemnation from governments in Europe and North America.Russia is a vital supplier of cut-price oil and weapons to India, but Moscow's isolation from the West and growing ties with Beijing have impacted its partnership with New Delhi.Western powers have in recent years also cultivated stronger relations with India as a hedge against China and its growing influence across the Asia-Pacific, while pressuring New Delhi to distance itself from Russia.The United States on Monday urged Modi to make clear in his talks with Putin that \"any resolution to the conflict in Ukraine must... be one that respects the UN Charter with respect to Ukraine's territorial integrity\".Modi last visited Russia in 2019 and hosted Putin in the Indian capital two years later, weeks before Russia began its offensive against Ukraine.India has largely shied away from explicit condemnation of Russia ever since and abstained on United Nations resolutions targeting the Kremlin.But Russia's fight with Ukraine has also had a human cost for India.New Delhi said in February it was pushing Moscow to return several of its citizens who had signed up for \"support jobs\" with the Russian military, following reports some had been killed after being forced to fight in Ukraine.Moscow's relationship with China has also been a cause for concern.Washington and the EU accuse China of selling components and equipment that have strengthened Russia's military industry -- allegations Beijing denies.China and India remain intense rivals competing for strategic influence across South Asia.India is also part of the Quad grouping with the US, Japan and Australia that positions itself against China's growing boldness in Asia.New Delhi and Russia have maintained close links since the Cold War, which saw the Kremlin become a key arms provider to the country. But Ukraine has stretched Russia's weapons supplies thin, pushing India to look for other sources for arms -- including growing its own defence industry.Russia's share of Indian imports of arms has shrunk considerably in recent years, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute.At the same time, India has become a major purchaser of Russian crude, providing a much-needed export market for Russia after it was dropped by traditional buyers in Europe.That has dramatically reconfigured their economic ties, with India saving itself billions of dollars while bolstering Moscow's war coffers.India's month-on-month imports of Russian crude \"increased by eight percent in May, to the highest levels since July 2023\", according to commodity tracking data compiled by the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air.But this has also resulted in India's trade deficit with Russia rising to a little over $57 billion in the past financial year.From Russia, Modi will travel to Vienna for the first visit to the Austrian capital by an Indian leader since Indira Gandhi in 1983.",

On Sunday, July 7, multiple sources confirmed to PEOPLE that the Barbie star, 34, is pregnant. An insider tells PEOPLE that she and her husband, also 34, have \u201cwanted to start a family for quite some time.\u201d \u201cFamily means a lot to both of them and they knew early on in their relationship being parents was something they really wanted,\u201d the source tells PEOPLE. \u201cThey've been keeping it under wraps for a while but are happy the news is out,\u201d adds the source. Never miss a story \u2014 sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from juicy celebrity news to compelling human interest stories. A set source previously told PEOPLE that \"no one suspected that she was pregnant\" while Robbie filmed her latest project, A Big Bold Beautiful Journey. Robbie \"was super professional and focused while filming,\" said the source, adding, \"She had long days, but it didn't seem like a big deal to her.\" \"[Margot] looked amazing and seemed very happy,\" the source tells PEOPLE. \"She got along with Colin [Farrell], and they had fun filming.\" A Big Bold Beautiful Journey, in which she stars alongside Farrell, is Robbie's first major acting project since the 2023 blockbuster Barbie. The expectant parents met in 2013 on the set of the World War II drama Suite Fran\u00e7aise. Robbie had a role in the film, while Acklerly served as an assistant director. Three years later, in December 2016, Robbie and Ackerly tied the knot during a private ceremony in Australia's Byron Bay. The two never announced their engagement prior to their wedding. Before their romantic relationship, the pair were platonic and worked together at the production company LuckyChap. The four-person producing team also includes Josey McNamara and Robbie's childhood friend Sophia Kerr. The company has produced several films and television series, including I, Tonya, Birds of Prey and Barbie \u2014 all of which starred Robbie. Before their wedding, Robbie confessed to Sunday Style in June 2016 that she wants \u201cTONS of children,\" adding with a laugh, \"Well, maybe not too many.\u201d \u201cI grew up in a family of four [kids], so that sounds like a good number,\u201d the I, Tonya star explained, in reference to her older siblings Anya and Lachlan and younger brother Cameron. \u201cWe\u2019ll see what happens; no time soon. I know that once I have kids, they\u2019ll be my priority, so I want to do the family thing later.\u201d",

In a new interview with Still Here Hollywood, Steve Kmetko asked the Pope of Greenwich Village star about his sister, Julia Roberts. \u201cYou'll have to ask her,\u201d Roberts responded. \u201cI love my sister, but I can't talk about her. She doesn't wanna talk about it.\u201d Roberts didn\u2019t discuss the matter further, and added another relative he\u2019s not encouraged to discuss: his daughter, Emma Roberts. \u201cMy daughter told me also not not to talk about her, but I stumble and do,\u201d he said. \u201cI'm not supposed to talk about either of them. But I do.\u201d Later in their conversation, Kmetko asked Roberts about his favorite performers. Rather than cite any particular influences or heroes, the actor instead used the opportunity to praise his daughter. \u201cI am in love with my daughter's work these days like I can't, I can't believe how great she's become,\u201d he said. \u201cI'm so proud of her I can't see straight. Since her performance in Maybe I Do until right now, she overwhelms me with pride and just, \u2018Oh my God. Here she goes again.\u2019 And I'm just so happy to be her dad because she's kicking ass, and I'm so proud.\u201d After Kmetko asked if Roberts \u201chad anything to do\u201d with his daughter\u2019s success, the actor responded, \u201cAbsolutely nothing. Except I gave her that name.\u201d Elsewhere in the interview, Roberts recounted his memories working on The Dark Knight, in which he played mobster Sal Maroni. \u201cIt was just fun to be associated with that movie,\u201d he said. [Christopher Nolan] is a real director, and he knows what he wants. And he tells you what he wants, and he gave me my favorite direction I ever got\u2026 \u2018Eric Roberts, don't be funny!\u2019... It was just hysterical that God's voice from the speakers told me not to be funny, and I'm not known for being funny at all. So it was a real pleasure for me to be told that.\u201d Want more movie news?

Roberts also said that Heath Ledger was a pleasure to work with. \u201cWhat a lovely person he was,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cI'd been told, \u2018Stay away from Heath. He's into the character. Oh, my God. He's gone.\u2019 He wasn't like that at all. He was perfectly fine.\u201d The actor said that at one point, Ledger asked his costars for feedback on his performance as the Joker. \u201cHe's going through the monologue, blah blah blah, and he gets to the monologue. And he's done with the monologue, and he's done. And he turns to us and he goes, \u2018How am I doing?\u2019 He's just so charming, so likable, so sweet, so normal. And all the stuff that I heard about him was not true. And he was a lovely person. He was a real loss.\u201d Listen to the full conversation between Roberts and Kmetko above.",

In a conversation with The New Yorker, the Academy Award winner, 60, spoke candidly about daughter August Francesca, 22 months, and sons Kal-El, 18, and Weston, 33. \u201cThey\u2019re all different experiences. Each one has a different mother,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not what I had originally thought would happen when I fell in love or got married \u2014 that I would have three different children with three different moms \u2014 but nonetheless that\u2019s what\u2019s happened,\u201d Cage continued. \"So every child is different. There\u2019s a different kind of level of attention.\u201d He shares Weston with ex Christina Fulton, Kal-El with his third wife, Alice Kim, and August with his fifth wife, Riko Shibata. Cage added that he worries about his \u201cvery adorable\u201d daughter, saying, \u201cSo this is all different levels of worry and protection and taking it into overdrive.\" He also remarked how being a father is intrinsic to his personhood. \"Being a dad \u2014 to me, it\u2019s not an art form, it\u2019s . . . How do I put this? It\u2019s like breathing. Everything is about her. You know, I can make a movie or not make a movie. I can\u2019t stop being a dad. With her, it\u2019s life. It\u2019s my survival,\" he explained.The Longlegs star welcomed eldest son, Weston, with girlfriend Fulton in December 1990.

In a 2015 interview with PEOPLE, Cage called Weston a \u201ctotal artist.\" \"He can do things I dream about doing \u2026 compose music, sing, act, sculpt and cook and now he is a loving father,\" he said. \"To see my son with my grandson is as close to a sense of blissful completion I ever had.\" Weston made Cage a grandfather in 2014, when he welcomed his son Lucian with ex-wife Danielle Cage. Weston and Danielle also welcomed son Sorin in 2016. In 2018, Weston wed Hila Cage Coppola in 2018, and the couple welcomed twin girls in 2020. Cage and Kim welcomed Kal-El Coppola in October 2005. The couple met in 2004 and were together for 12 years until they separated in January 2016. In September 2022, Cage and Shibata welcomed their first child together. \"My boys are all grown up, and I miss going to the toy store. I miss singing lullabies and rocking in the rocking chair,\" he told Access Hollywood in April 2022. \"I'm looking forward to getting back to that.\" Cage was also married to Patricia Arquette from 1995 to 2001. He then married the late Lisa Marie Presley, daughter of Elvis and Priscilla Presley, in August 2002 and filed for divorce three months later. After his marriage to Kim, Cage tied the knot to the makeup artist Erika Koike in March 2019 in Las Vegas after a year of dating. The two divorced in June 2019. Cage's next film, Longlegs, opens on July 12.",

        "text": "Scarlett Johansson's latest film may revolve around space exploration, but the actress has something else she'd rather explore instead. When asked what conspiracy theory she's intrigued by other than the moon landing, Johansson, 39, revealed that she would love to learn more about Dolly Parton's body art. \"I don't know. I'm so not a conspiracy theorist. I'm like, I really believe in science. I don't know. I think probably that Dolly Parton has full tattooed sleeves,\" she tells PEOPLE at the Monday, July 8 world premiere of Fly Me to the Moon held at New York's AMC Lincoln Square Theater. After giving a sly smile, she playfully adds, \"Is it real? We'll find out.\" Johansson, who attended the event alongside her husband Colin Jost, knows a thing or two about conspiracy theories, as her latest project is inspired by the Apollo 11 moon landing and the belief that it was staged by the U.S. government. In a September 2020 conversation with PEOPLE, Parton, 78, confirmed that she does have \"some tattoos\" and described them as \"tasteful.\" \"My tattoos are pretty, they\u2019re artful and they usually started out to cover some scar, not to make a big statement. Ribbons and bows and butterflies are the things that I have,\" she said. The country music legend explained why they are her way of making something beautiful from an ugly experience. \"I was very sick for a while, and I had to wear a feeding tube. It left a little indention in my side and I didn't like it because I\u2019m so fair that scars turn purple on me,\" Parton said. \"I like to make positives out of negatives. I had a little beehive tattooed over it \u2014 a little yellow-and-brown beehive with a tiny little bee on top of the hive. The mouth of it is that little sinkhole.\" Johansson's latest project finds her playing Kelly Jones, a member of the marketing team tasked with rehabilitating NASA\u2019s public image. She stars alongside Channing Tatum, who plays launch director Cole Davis. The actress, who is also a producer on the film, described her character in a previous conversation with PEOPLE as a \"very modern woman living in a time where women were often underestimated.\" Never miss a story \u2014 sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories. \"She uses that to her advantage and is always a few steps ahead,\" she said, adding that the overall film is \"totally original.\" \"It\u2019s not derivative of anything else, it doesn\u2019t follow a formula,\" said Johansson. \"I think audiences haven\u2019t been offered a big-idea movie that is both funny and poignant and original in a long time, and they are hungry for that. The film is totally entertaining and fresh. I\u2019m very proud of it for its newness and scope.\" The movie star attended the premiere of the Greg Berlanti-directed project in a chic custom Prada top and skirt in faille vichy, with crystal embroidery trim and silver leather sandals. Fly Me to the Moon hits theaters on July 12.",

        "text": "Did George Stephanopoulos do an interview with Joe Biden, or an intervention? The New York Post said it was an intervention. The New York Times hailed the ABC host \"respectfully but firmly\" channeling the questions of all Americans. He did not. He was channeling the panic among Democrats. Times media reporter Michael Grynbaum\u2019s article was headlined: For George Stephanopoulos, 22 Minutes of Probing the Personal. Respectfully but firmly, the ABC anchor pressed President Biden on the basic questions that Americans had asked themselves over the past week. \"Respectfully but firmly,\" he asked, \u201cAre you more frail?\u201d and \"Have there been more lapses?\u201d As Biden denied he had a problem, \"Stephanopoulos zeroed in on the matters of pride, dignity and self-worth swirling beneath the surface.\" This was positively cuddly with ABC, compared to the Times rant against NBC's Matt Lauer after a tougher Trump town hall program in 2016. James Poniewozik angrily wrote: \"he performed like a soldier sent on a mission without ammunition, beginning with a disorganized offensive, ending in a humiliating retreat.\" With a limited time for the interview, Stephanopoulos wasn\u2019t going to turn to any policy issue. Or any Biden scandal. With limited time, he clearly avoided any followup questions about all the wild claims Biden was making. \"I was also the guy that expanded NATO. I was also the guy that grew the economy....I'm the guy that shut Putin down.\" He said Sen. Mark Warner ran for president. Plainly false. Instead, Stephanopoulos nudged him that he might regret staying in the race. \u201cIf you stay in, and Trump is elected, and everything you\u2019re warning about comes to pass,\u201d he asked, \u201chow will you feel in January?\u201d This was Democrats trying to talk Biden into leaving. Democrats are seeking reassurance, and not really finding any. After the primetime interview aired in full, Jonathan Karl came on and insisted it didn\u2019t really help Biden solve his problem. On George's show This Week on Sunday, he told his pundit panel some people suggest it would be best for Biden to resign and let Kamala be the incumbent president against Trump. Susan Page of USA Today said \u201cYou know, hard enough to get Joe Biden to agree not to run for a second term, to make him limit his first term which has been by many accounts incredibly successful and consequential, I think that is a bridge too far.\u201d This is where you can really see the partisan bias of the press. Biden is massively trailing Trump on a number of issues, but Susan Page is talking up his \"incredibly successful\" presidency. They\u2019re trying to convince voters to pick him again. Speaking of a failure to fact-Check Democrats, Jorge Bonilla caught a whopper from Donna Brazile on the Stephanopoulos show. George didn\u2019t stop her either, as she claimed Kamala Harris spoke to a crowd of 60,000 people in New Orleans. That's a whopper! But at Politifact, Brazile's\"Truth-O-Meter\" page is TEN on the true side, ONE on the false side. (4 Half True). On top of that, PolitiFact has NO \"fact checks\" on Karine Jean-Pierre's lies and denialism about Biden's decline, including the \"no doctors\" one. She has FOUR checks, the last two were \"Mostly True.\" (She drew two \"False\" notes in the summer of 2022.) Jen Psaki was even worse. One True, One False...and nothing from her MSNBC stuff.

        "text": "In a surprise triumph over the populist National Rally, France\u2019s left-wing political alliance came first in Sunday\u2019s final round of parliamentary elections. The New Popular Front coalition of leftists won 182 seats, President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s party won 168 seats, and the National Rally and its allies won 143 seats. Many in the Western media are celebrating the National Rally\u2019s failure to secure a parliamentary majority. In some ways we agree that it is a good thing that the National Rally will not control all policy. For, while National Rally seeks to secure France\u2019s borders, which is a desperate need, it is also economically statist and parochial and anti-American, which are regrettable. It cannot properly be called right-wing at all, let alone \u201cfar right,\u201d which is the insult thrown at it by leftist legacy news media. But the Left\u2019s win is nothing to celebrate. Led by left-wing stalwart Jean-Luc Melenchon, the victorious coalition demands to pick the next prime minister. This is a problem for many reasons, foremost among them the fact that Melenchon is a deeply unpleasant politician. He is a creature of the European Left\u2019s fetishistic and deluded anti-Americanism. He seems to believe that America is the cause of most of the world\u2019s ills. He despises NATO and sympathizes with Vladimir Putin and his imperial war against Ukraine. He is hostile toward Israel and Jews and has made numerous blatantly antisemitic remarks. Yet he is now a political kingmaker. Melenchon\u2019s policies are as ridiculous as they will prove damaging if implemented. The coalition has pledged to reverse Macron\u2019s increase of the pension eligibility age from 60 to 64. It wants price controls on key goods, higher public sector wages, and expanded welfare benefits. The French economy is already weak, overburdened by taxes and regulations, runs a high fiscal deficit, and has a soaring debt-to-GDP ratio of 111%. Expanding benefits for an aging population amid economic sclerosis is a recipe for national failure. The French Left has never shown much sensible restraint. It wants what it has long wanted, which is to extract benefits today at the expense of future generations. It indulges in the politics of emotion and protest rather than of logic and good governance. Its pro-immigration policies also seem designed to ensure the National Rally keeps gaining popular support in advance of the 2027 presidential election. The Left opposes immigration controls and wants additional welfare benefits for migrants and new staff to process asylum claims. The National Rally is furious that it has been defeated by the strategic voting orchestrated by an alliance of otherwise disparate political parties working to obstruct it. But it will now gather new supporters by spending the next three years pointing out the dysfunction of a divided government. Macron faces parliamentary opponents who despise him and wish to embarrass him. While he has recently shown robust support for Ukraine, he may be hesitant to use what little political capital he has left on that issue. It\u2019s going to be a tough few years for the president. But it\u2019s going to be even tougher for the French people. France has chosen a mad Left instead of a populist Right. Even if delayed, the Right is surely now on the path to power.",

The actress, 27, who portrayed Amy Winehouse in the 2024 biopic Back to Black, is set to tie the knot to her West End actor boyfriend, Jamie Bogyo, after four years of dating, Boygo happily revealed the news in an Instagram post on Sunday, July 7, which began with a photo of Abela smiling from ear to ear while sporting her new ring and holding a red rose. He playfully captioned the post, \"She said she\u2019ll think about it!\" The photo was followed by a video of Abela wrapping her legs around Bogyo while sharing a kiss and a clip of their loved ones surprising them after the special moment. While Abela has yet to open up about the news on her own social media account, she commented on Boygo's post. \"A weeping mess. ?,\" she wrote. In December, Bogyo celebrated their romance by sharing a sweet Instagram tribute to Abela on her birthday. \"Some folks can\u2019t stand it, say time is a bandit, but I take the opposite view\u2026 Cause when I need a lift ?time brings a gift ? another day with you! Happy Birthday baby- you\u2019re timeless to me. \u2764\ufe0f,\" he wrote next to various photos chronicling their time together. The engagement news comes months after Abela portrayed the late singer in Back to Black, which shares its title with Winehouse's second and final album. \u201cI'm really excited. It doesn't feel like it's me singing,\" she told PEOPLE in April at the film's world premiere in London. \"You know, when you inhabit a character, you do what it is that you need to do,\" she continued. \"And that's my job as an actor to inhabit her in every corner of her life and to be able to tell the story at every single moment of her life.\" Abela told PEOPLE that playing Winehouse, who died from accidental alcohol poisoning in 2011 at the age of 27, allowed her to learn more about authenticity.

The message to President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and other potential adversaries would be that a larger, more powerful group of Western allies had emerged, after more than two years of war in Ukraine, more dedicated than ever to pushing back on aggression. But as 38 world leaders began arriving here on Monday, that confidence seems at risk. Even before the summit formally begins, it has been overshadowed by the uncertainty about whether Mr. Biden will remain in the race for a second term, and the looming possibility of the return of former President Donald J. Trump. Mr. Trump once declared NATO \u201cobsolete,\u201d threatened to exit the alliance and more recently said he would let the Russians do \u201cwhatever the hell they want\u201d to any member country he deemed to be insufficiently contributing to the alliance.

        "text": "ANALYSIS \u2014 Democratic lawmakers are setting a high bar for what President Joe Biden needs to show voters as the party splinters over his cognitive abilities and candidacy. But can the 81-year-old commander in chief clear it? \u201cBiden\u2019s candidacy, today, does not feel sustainable,\u201d former Rep. Charlie Dent, R-Pa., said in a Monday phone interview. \u201cI\u2019m not one to put a timeline on this, but boy, the narrative is not getting any better. \u201cI have to think, if you\u2019re a Democratic congressman right now, down-ballot races matter. And congressional Democrats are concerned about maintaining their majority in the Senate, and they know their ability to take back the House is probably less likely today than it was before the debate,\u201d Dent, a Biden voter in 2020, said of Biden\u2019s poor June 27 performance against Donald Trump, the expected GOP nominee. \u201cAn epic collapse at the top of the ticket is disastrous for down-ballot races. \u2026 The bottom line is: A lot of people have carried the president\u2019s water, and now they feel gaslit or betrayed.\u201d Biden on Monday told MSNBC he still believes he is the best candidate to defeat Trump, though he called his poor debate performance a \u201cterrible night.\u201d He called his term a \u201csignificant run\u201d and said his February physical exam included a neurological check-up that turned up no medical issues. \u201cIt drives me nuts, people talking about this,\u201d he added, listing his public appearances since the debate. \u201cI\u2019m not going to explain any more about what I should or shouldn\u2019t do. I am running.\u201d The president was equally blunt in a letter to congressional Democrats sent Monday, writing: \u201cI want you to know that despite all the speculation in the press and elsewhere, I am firmly committed to staying in this race, to running this race to the end, and to beating Donald Trump.\u201d The president concluded the letter by telling Capitol Hill Democrats that \u201cany weakening of resolve or lack of clarity about the task ahead only helps Trump and hurts us.\u201d Biden will get a number of chances to prove himself during what will be another make-or-break week as he hosts a NATO summit in Washington, D.C., that will culminate in a solo news conference that Democratic lawmakers and donors surely will be watching closely. While the president had a dismal debate performance against Trump, Biden was more clear and showed more vigor during a Friday rally in Madison, Wis. Still, he was at times dismissive about Democrats\u2019 concerns about his ability to defeat Trump \u2014 and, at other times, indecipherable. Biden on Monday showed no signs of considering dropping out of the race after telling ABC News in an interview that aired Friday evening that only the \u201cLord Amighty\u201d could drive him from his rematch with Trump. But he appears to have lost even some of his closest allies and admirers on Capitol Hill. Because lawmakers face a new group of reporters around almost every corner when they are in session, their suddenly bleak collective assessments of his mental capacity and odds of beating Trump will do little this week to change popular perceptions about the president. Rep. Adam B. Schiff, D-Calif., and other lawmakers have gone so far as to call for Biden \u2014 and the 78-year-old Trump \u2014 to take cognitive tests so voters have a clear picture about each candidate\u2019s true mental health. \u201cLook, I\u2019d be happy if both the president and Donald Trump took cognitive tests,\u201d Schiff told NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d on Sunday. \u201cI think, frankly, a test would show Donald Trump has a serious illness of one kind or another.\u201d But Schiff, the Democratic nominee for a Senate seat in his state, also did not say that Biden should stay in the race. \u201cIf [Biden\u2019s] decision is to run, then run hard and beat that S.O.B.,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd if his decision is to pass the torch, then the president should do everything in his power to make that other candidate successful.\u201d Some longtime Biden allies such as Sen. Thomas R. Carper of Delaware are standing by him. \u201cI met him 50 years ago and he\u2019s been my friend for 50 years,\u201d Carper told reporters Monday. \u201cI\u2019ve supported him in everything that he\u2019s run for. \u2026 I have no interest in walking away from him today, or tomorrow or the day after that.\u201d Carper, a Democrat who is not seeking reelection, said Biden will have \u201cplenty of opportunities to show if he still has what it takes and I think he deserves a chance to demonstrate that.\u201d \u201cThe goal here is to reelect President Biden,\u201d said Sen. Mark Kelly, a Democrat of Arizona. He expressed skepticism about polls showing Biden losing Kelly\u2019s home state to Donald Trump. \u201cWhat I can tell you from my personal experience with public polling, it\u2019s not entirely accurate.\u201d Biden will not get any younger before Election Day. He has perhaps the most stressful job in the world. And he has suffered a number of tragedies in his personal life. He admits he is not as smooth a talker these days, nor as feisty of a debater. Even on Monday morning, he started some thoughts before pivoting to another, and slurred some words. Sen. Martin Heinrich, D-N.M., said Monday that \u201cPresident Biden needs to continue to demonstrate that his debate performance was just a bad night, and that he has a clear path to defeating Donald Trump,\u201d adding in a statement: \u201cOur democracy hangs in the balance.\u201d House Armed Services Committee ranking member Adam Smith, D-Wash., told CNN on Monday that he wants Biden to clear a path for Vice President Kamala Harris. \u201cPersonally, I think Kamala Harris would be a much better, stronger candidate,\u201d he said. \u2018Not going anywhere\u2019 Sen. Brian Schatz, D-Hawaii, said Democratic lawmakers need to have a series of \u201cfamily conversations\u201d about the best way forward. But Brad Bannon, a Democratic strategist, said Monday the president is not trying to out-swim the sharks in his own party. \u201cNothing will satisfy the doubting Democratic dissidents. They want President Biden gone and they have set the bar so high that an Olympic high jumper couldn\u2019t get over it,\u201d he said in an email. \u201cThe president could recite the NATO charter in French while doing a handstand and it wouldn\u2019t change any minds. The blood is in the water. \u2026 It will be tough for President Biden to hang on.\u201d Michael Bitzer, a political science professor at North Carolina\u2019s Catawba College, said Monday, \u201cBiden must engage in a reassuring campaign to his own base and to that small sliver of the persuadable electorate and give them a sense of a future of competence, reassurance, and forward looking. If it\u2019s a negative partisanship campaign strategy, it feels like that\u2019s advantage Trump, as he can rile up his base more effectively than Biden can. \u201cIf this week\u2019s solo press conference falls flat, or worse yet is a repeat of the debate debacle, then no amount of letters to congressional Democrats or interviews will help construct that reassurance campaign,\u201d he added in an email. For now, at least, Biden has remained defiant. At several points in the Monday MSNBC telephone interview, Biden went hard against Trump, calling him a \u201cliar\u201d who is only out for himself. \u201cBy the way, you hear Trump talking about all he\u2019s done and all that. And you know, Trump, Trump at the debate night, he\u2019s a pathological liar,\u201d the president said Monday morning. \u201cHe lied about Roe, he refuses to accept the outcome of the [2020] election, he refused to condemn Jan. 6. And he says, they claimed, he spoke with [Russian President Vladimir] Putin before he invaded [Ukraine]. \u201cWhat the hell are we doing, Joe?\u201d Biden asked \u201cMorning Joe\u201d host Joe Scarborough, a former GOP House member. \u201cWhat are we doing? This is bizarre.\u201d Biden took a direct shot at his critics, showing flashes of his \u201cScranton Joe\u201d persona that was a more common feature during his decades in the Senate than his time as vice president and now president. \u201cI\u2019m getting so frustrated by the elites \u2026 in the party. \u2018Oh, they know so much more,\u2019\u201d he said mockingly before issuing a challenge: \u201cRun against me. Go ahead, announce for president. Challenge me at the convention.\u201d While House and Senate Democrats returned to Washington on Monday to opine about Biden and his embattled reelection bid \u2014 with some expected to formally call on him to step aside \u2014 the president dug in further during his morning interview. \u201cThe bottom line here is: We\u2019re not going anywhere,\u201d he said of his campaign. \u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere.\u201d (Daniela Altimari and Aidan Quigley contributed to this report.)",

        "text": "SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) \u2014 Alec Baldwin\u2019s trial in the shooting of a cinematographer is set to begin Tuesday with the selection of jurors who will be tasked with deciding whether the actor is guilty of involuntary manslaughter. Getting chosen to serve in a trial of such a major star accused of such a major crime would be unusual even in Los Angeles or Baldwin\u2019s hometown of New York. But it will be essentially an unheard-of experience for those who are picked as jurors in Santa Fe, New Mexico, though the state has increasingly become a hub of Hollywood production in recent years. Baldwin, 66, could get up to 18 months in prison if jurors unanimously decide he committed the felony when a revolver he was pointing at cinematographer Halyna Hutchins went off, killing her and wounding director Joel Souza during a rehearsal for the Western film \u201cRust\u201d in October 2021 at Bonanza Creek Ranch, some 18 miles (29 kilometers) from where the trial is being held. Baldwin has said the gun fired accidentally after he followed instructions to point it toward Hutchins, who was behind the camera. Unaware the gun contained a live round, Baldwin said he pulled back the hammer \u2014 not the trigger \u2014 and it fired. The star of \u201c30 Rock\u201d and \u201cThe Hunt for Red October\u201d made his first appearance in the courtroom on Monday, when Judge Mary Marlowe Summer, in a significant victory for the defense, ruled at a pretrial hearing that Baldwin\u2019s role as a co-producer on \u201cRust\u201d isn\u2019t relevant to the trial. The judge has said that the special circumstances of a celebrity trial shouldn\u2019t keep jury selection from moving quickly, and that opening statements should begin Wednesday. \u201cI\u2019m not worried about being able to pick a jury in one day,\u201d Marlowe Summer said. \u201cI think we\u2019re going to pick a jury by the afternoon.\u201d Special prosecutor Kari Morrissey, however, was dubious that Baldwin\u2019s lawyers, with whom she has clashed in the run-up to the trial, would make that possible. \u201cIt is my guess that with this group of defense attorneys, that\u2019s not gonna happen,\u201d Morrissey said at the hearing. Baldwin attorney Alex Spiro replied, \u201cI\u2019ve never not picked a jury in one day. I can\u2019t imagine that this would be the first time.\u201d Dozens of prospective jurors will be brought into the courtroom for questioning Tuesday morning. Cameras that will carry the rest of the proceedings will be turned off to protect their privacy. Jurors are expected to get the case after a nine-day trial. Attorneys will be able to request they be dismissed for conflicts or other causes. The defense under state law can dismiss up to five jurors without giving a reason, the prosecution three. More challenges will be allowed when four expected alternates are chosen. Before Marlowe Sommer\u2019s ruling Monday, prosecutors had hoped to highlight Baldwin\u2019s safety obligations on the set as co-producer to bolster an alternative theory of guilt beyond his alleged negligent use of a firearm. They aimed to link Baldwin\u2019s behavior to \u201ctotal disregard or indifference for the safety of others\u201d under the involuntary manslaughter law. But the prosecution managed other wins Monday. They successfully argued for the exclusion of summary findings from a state workplace safety investigation that placed much of the blame on the film\u2019s assistant director, shifting fault away from Baldwin. And the judge ruled that they could show graphic images from Hutchins\u2019 autopsy, and from police lapel cameras during the treatment of her injuries. ___ Dalton reported from Los Angeles. ___ For more coverage of Alec Baldwin\u2019s involuntary manslaughter trial, visit: https://apnews.com/hub/alec-baldwin",

        "text": "The recent gossip concerning Hollywood celebrities Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez has attracted much attention from the public. Although the couple has not made any official statement about their relationship status, they have been seen apart, which has fueled rumors and speculations. More recently, the music icon was seen having a good time on a summer day at the Hamptons. Lopez, known for This Is Me...Now, was cycling with her friend and vocal coach Stevie Mackey during her visit to the coastal area of Long Island, New York, according to Page Six. Mackey posted a picture on Instagram featuring himself and Lopez seated on identical Linus bicycles against the backdrop of a scenic summer home. In the caption, he wrote, \u201cGood times, good friends, good wheels.\" The photo showed Lopez in a brown sweater, flowing white linen pants, and white sneakers, noticeably wearing her wedding ring. Meanwhile, in Los Angeles, Affleck was also photographed wearing his wedding ring. Mackey also posted a cryptic quote on his Instagram Story. It read, \u201cLife is like riding a bicycle. In order to keep your balance, you must keep moving.\u201d Affleck was notably absent from Lopez's trip to Long Island. Lopez and Affleck have recently been seen apart, frequently choosing not to wear their wedding rings. As reported by Us Weekly, a source revealed, \u201cThey can\u2019t get on the same page [and] have been discussing divorce as an option.\" In May, another source said, \u201c[Affleck] feels like the last two years was just a fever dream, and he\u2019s come to his senses now and understands there is just no way this is going to work.\" The stars of Gigli have maintained separate lifestyles in recent weeks, sparking increased speculation among fans. A source had earlier revealed, \u201cThey are taking some space to work out whether or not the relationship is right for both of them. Jennifer had started ramping up her work commitments and prepping for her tour. She\u2019s very focused on work and overextends herself.\u2026 He\u2019s been checked out\u2026[they are on] two completely different pages most of the time. The honeymoon phase has worn off.\u201d Shortly after, it was reported by Glamour that Lopez had decided to cancel her upcoming world tour to prioritize spending more time with her family. This could be seen as a troubling indication for the couple. In a personal statement to her fans, Lopez said, \u201cI am completely heartsick and devastated about letting you down. Please know that I wouldn\u2019t do this if I didn\u2019t feel that it was absolutely necessary. I promise I will make it up to you and we will all be together again. I love you all so much.\" Meanwhile, the couple tied the knot in Las Vegas in July 2022, marking their reunion after their early 2000s relationship. Lopez has twins Max and Emme with her ex-husband Marc Anthony, while Affleck shares parenting responsibilities for Violet, Seraphina, and Samuel with his ex-wife, Jennifer Garner.",

The Devil Wears Prada writer Aline Brosh McKenna is reportedly working on the sequel to the 2006 box office hit, reports Puck News. Wendy Finerman, producer of the original film, is set to develop and produce the follow-up. Deadline reports that the original director David Frankel is having conversations about a return. While McKenna and Finerman are reportedly attached, no casting deals are in place. The Oscar-nominated film starred Anne Hathaway, Meryl Streep, Emily Blunt, Stanley Tucci and Adrian Grenier. Fox 2000 Pictures, which was the studio behind the original film, is now owned by Disney through its acquisition of 20th Century Fox in 2019. A representative for Disney did not immediately respond to PEOPLE\u2019s request for more information on Monday.

The 2006 film based on Lauren Weisberger\u2019s book of the same name follows recent college journalism graduate Andy Sachs (Hathaway), who lands the job as the assistant to Miranda Priestly (Streep), the editor-in-chief of the fictional magazine Runway. As Andy takes in the world of fashion magazines, she is assisted by her fellow assistant Emily Charlton (Blunt) and art director, Nigel (Tucci). After its June 2006 release, the film grossed a massive $326 million at the worldwide box office and earned Streep, 75, her fourteenth Oscar nomination. Puck reports that the plot may follow Priestly, who still runs Runway, as she navigates the state of contemporary publishing and the magazine\u2019s financial hardship. Meanwhile, Emily will be an executive at one of Runway\u2019s luxury brand conglomerates that advertises with the publication. Blunt and Hathaway have expressed their satisfaction with the film's lack of a sequel. More recently, in April, Hathaway, 41, told Extra that fans shouldn\u2019t \"hold out too much hope\u201d for a sequel. In March, she told E! News she didn\u2019t \u201cthink a continuation of that story is probably ever gonna happen.\u201d In February, Blunt, 41, shared on the Happy Sad Confused podcast that the cast is \u201cgood\u201d without making a sequel. \u201cSometimes things should be cherished and preserved in this bubble and it\u2019s okay.\" Six years earlier, Blunt told PEOPLE she didn't think a second movie was likely but added, \"If everyone did it, I would be up for it.\" \"I almost hope it doesn't [happen] because I think sometimes when you sequel everything kind of dilutes how special the original is,\" Blunt said. Then in a 2022 interview on The View, Blunt told the co-hosts that she \u201cwould do [a sequel] in a heartbeat just to play with those guys again.\u201d However, days before Blunt told The View co-hosts she was willing to return to the set, Hathaway shared with the co-hosts that she didn\u2019t know if there could be a sequel. She added that it would be \u201ctempting\u201d to create a sequel following the beloved character, but she doesn\u2019t \u201cthink it's gonna happen.\" Hathaway proposed a movie with a new cast, adding, \"But they could relaunch it. They could find new people and do it. Do you think they'd let us do that?\"",

Yet his words may come as a surprise. Considering the war in Gaza, Russia\u2019s onslaught in Ukraine and conflict in Sudan, can we still speak of a prewar era? Mr. Tusk, a former president of the European Council, could perhaps be accused of Eurocentrism. But his remark is right: We are not in a traditional war. Yet of all the conflicts currently playing out, the one in Ukraine \u2014 which pitches autocratically aligned Russia against Western-backed Ukraine \u2014 has the greatest potential to become a full-blown world war. For NATO members gathered this week in Washington, working out how to stop that from happening will be at the top of the agenda. They\u2019re unlikely to agree, though. For the two and a half years since Russia\u2019s invasion, Western countries have pursued divergent, sometimes contradictory approaches to the war. Behind each country\u2019s policy is a special perspective, informed by history. It\u2019s like a pair of glasses, casting the war in a different light. As Vladimir Putin threatens nuclear escalation and Ukraine suffers further assaults, it\u2019s essential that NATO members decide together how they should see the war in Ukraine \u2014 and how best to bring it to an end. Some believe that we are on the eve of a wider war, experiencing an equivalent of something that happened 100 years ago. This is the view through Sarajevo glasses. There, on a hot summer day in 1914, a young assassin opened fire on Archduke Franz Ferdinand\u2019s vehicle, setting off a chaotic sequence that led to World War I. That war, which was extraordinarily devastating, began somewhat by accident. The historian Christopher Clark has called the political class of the time \u201csleepwalkers.\u201d Through a complex mix of emotions, offended honor and recklessness, they wandered unwittingly into war.",

This in a crucial year for our continent, with Vladimir Putin still pummelling Ukraine and Donald Trump again likely to become president of the US, unless Joe Biden steps aside as he should. Let\u2019s start with the good news, before getting depressed again. Britain has a responsible, pragmatic government of the centre-left, elected for up to five years. It\u2019s led by a former human rights lawyer determined to defend the rule of law at home and internationally; embraces a judicious mix of market economy, state intervention and social justice; strongly supports Ukraine and is committed to pursuing good relations with other European countries. In fact, it\u2019s a much better match to the values proclaimed in article 2 of the Treaty on European Union than the government of the EU member state Hungary, whose anti-liberal nationalist leader, Viktor Orb\u00e1n, has been sitting down with Putin in Moscow to see how they can compel Ukraine to capitulate in the name of \u201cpeace\u201d. But here\u2019s the snag: Britain (in case you hadn\u2019t noticed) is no longer a member of Europe\u2019s core political and economic community. As if in training to run the 100m at the Paris Olympics, David Lammy, Britain\u2019s new foreign minister, visited his counterparts in Germany, Poland and Sweden in only his first few days in office. Meanwhile, John Healey, the new defence minister, hastened to Odesa for talks with his Ukrainian opposite number. Lammy has been emphatic and eloquent in calling for a \u201creset\u201d, a \u201cfresh start\u201d and a \u201cclose partnership\u201d with the EU and individual European countries. Britain proposes a new UK-EU security pact, with closer cooperation in many areas. Lots of goodwill has been expressed in Berlin, Paris, Warsaw and other European capitals. But the fact that the UK is institutionally just another \u201cthird country\u201d for the EU means that the process of negotiating this new, closer relationship will be complicated, with numerous blocking or veto possibilities for various national, party-political and bureaucratic players inside the EU. Moreover, the red lines that Starmer proclaimed in order to win pro-Brexit voters back to Labour \u2013 no return to the EU\u2019s customs union, single market or freedom of movement \u2013 seriously limit what can be done on the economic front. And British politics is not as different from that on continental Europe as it seems at first glance. A key reason for the scale of Labour\u2019s victory was that the rightwing vote was split between the Conservatives and Nigel Farage\u2019s Reform party, which is the British \u2013 or more precisely, the English \u2013 equivalent of Marine Le Pen\u2019s National Rally, Germany\u2019s AfD or Italy\u2019s Fratelli d\u2019Italia, channelling widespread popular economic and cultural concerns into the scapegoating of immigration. Farage\u2019s Fratelli d\u2019Inghilterra \u2013 or, if you prefer, Alternative f\u00fcr England \u2013 got about 14% of the popular vote, compared to about 24% for the Tories. Nationalist populist sentiments on both sides of the Channel will constrain and complicate the UK-EU reset, while on both sides the hard right is getting stronger. Still and all, the news from London is more encouraging than that from Paris. Yes, an astronaut orbiting our planet would have heard a huge sigh of relief rising from the entire European continent at 8pm French time on Sunday evening, as we learned that RN had not repeated its spectacular success in the first round of this parliamentary election and would only be the third-largest group in the national assembly, the lower house of the French parliament. But that\u2019s where the good news ends. If in Britain the popular vote was first and foremost to kick the Conservatives out, in France it was to keep RN out, not to put anyone in particular in. The result is a parliament split between three main groups: the hastily assembled New Popular Front (NFP), a loose leftwing coalition of four very different parties, including the Eurosceptic and populist France Unbowed; Macron\u2019s centrist Ensemble, which is not really a party just a, well, ensemble; and RN, which is a very disciplined party. None has a majority on its own. All the options being discussed for forming a government are likely to be unstable and fissiparous. The country has a soaring national debt and large budget deficit. Expansive spending plans from the NFP could yet provoke the wrath of the bond markets and trouble the eurozone. According to the constitution, the president is not allowed to call new elections for another year. In opposition, RN may well gain even more support, preparing for a presidential run by Le Pen or Jordan Bardella in 2027. In sum, while Britain has a strong government but a weak position in Europe, France will have a strong position in Europe but a weak government. Macron\u2019s authority and influence is greatly diminished \u2013 and that\u2019s entirely his own fault. The former British prime minister Rishi Sunak probably miscalculated in calling an early election (and then conducted a rain-soaked, gaffe-filled campaign), but he would have been obliged to call an election by the end of the year anyway. The writing was on the wall for the Conservatives, after 14 years in power during which they have done such damage to this country. Macron, by contrast, had a relative although not an absolute majority for his centrist grouping in a parliament that was elected until 2027, the year in which his presidential term ends. I remember watching him in Normandy on the D-day anniversary on 6 June, and saying to myself, \u201cthere\u2019s a man who has succumbed to hubris\u201d. Just three days later, the \u201cJupiterian\u201d president made his hasty, melodramatic announcement of a snap parliamentary election, manifesting that particularly pernicious form of stupidity that he unfortunately shares with some elite British advocates of Brexit: the stupidity of highly educated and intelligent people. As a result, Jupiter has become Icarus. Calling for a political \u201cclarification\u201d, he has achieved the opposite. For all of Europe, the tragedy is that Macron has also been the most powerful advocate of what we Europeans urgently need, in an overheating world torn between Putin, Trump and Xi Jinping: more unity, more coherence, more power. Or as he puts it: l\u2019Europe puissance. And he has recently become the most influential west European voice in favour of increased support for an embattled Ukraine, whose fate today hangs in the balance. Only a few weeks ago, Macron was warning us that \u201cEurope is mortal\u201d. Now, in an act of folly and hubris, he has stabbed both himself and Europe in the back.

        "text": "The multi-talented actress and singer Jennifer Lopez, also known as JLo, gave candid opinions about other actresses, including Gwyneth Paltrow, in an interview from 1998. The interview, which was published by Movieline, provides a glimpse into the superstar's unfiltered opinions during an important point in her career. The conversation offers a fascinating look at Hollywood dynamics and Lopez's perspective on others in the industry. Lopez talked about her position in the entertainment business in the interview, calling herself \"at the bottom of the A-list of actresses,\" according to Instyle. When the conversation went to Gwyneth Paltrow, she spoke candidly and said, \"Tell me what she's been in? I swear to God, I don't remember anything she was in. Some people get hot by association. I heard more about her and Brad Pitt than I ever heard about her work.\" This seemingly harsh remark seems to imply that Paltrow's romance with Bradd Pitt had a major effect on her career. Paltrow and Pitt were a well-known couple at the time, and their connection was unavoidably covered by the media. It's important to note that Paltrow had already acted in many movies, which received positive reviews and contributed to her rise to stardom. She acted in movies such as Sliding Doors, the historical comedy Emma, A Perfect Murder, Seven, and Great Expectations in addition to other films. Nevertheless, Lopez claimed that the only reason Paltrow was brought up at all was because of her connection to Pitt. The interview also revealed Lopez's viewpoint on other actresses. She gave both praise and criticism of Salma Hayek, Cameron Diaz, Winona Ryder, and Madonna based on her observations of their professional careers. It's crucial to remember that the interview was conducted more than 20 years ago when there were differences in the media environment. Lopez later emphasized that her words were frequently misinterpreted and taken out of context. She lamented the way the media interpreted her statements in a Vanity Fair article from 2011 in which she conveyed her annoyance. \u201cI was so misquoted and so taken out of context, and it\u2019s a sore subject for me,\u201d Lopez said. \u201cI don\u2019t like to hurt anybody. I don\u2019t like to hurt their feelings. I like to joke, so I do that sometimes. What they wrote in that article hurt people. [After reading it] I just sat down and cried for hours.\u201d Lopez has established herself as an outstanding performer with a strong filmography and a successful music career. She is not only a talented actress, dancer, and singer, but also a successful businesswoman. She runs a successful fashion line, beauty line, and an alcohol brand in addition to having several chart-topping records and prominent roles in big-budget films.",

        "text": "Alec Baldwin's manslaughter trial over the fatal 2021 shooting on the set of a Western movie begins Tuesday, with the selection of a jury who must decide if a \"Rust\" crew member's death was his fault.The Hollywood A-lister was pointing a prop gun at cinematographer Halyna Hutchins during a scene rehearsal when it fired a live round, killing her and wounding the movie's director.Baldwin, 66, says he did not know the gun was loaded and did not pull the trigger. Prosecutors say he acted recklessly on set and has repeatedly changed his story since the tragic events of October 2021.Multiple attempts by Baldwin's lawyers to have the case thrown out have failed. On Monday, the actor attended a final pre-trial hearing, taking detailed notes on a yellow pad that he stashed in a Barnes & Noble tote bag.Jury selection begins Tuesday, with opening arguments expected Wednesday and the case in the southwestern state of New Mexico due to last around 10 days.Due to the \"30 Rock\" actor's immense fame, and the rarity of on-set deaths, the story has garnered global attention while sharply polarizing opinion.Sympathetic observers view Baldwin as a victim who has been pursued by prosecutors in part due to his status as a celebrity and liberal darling.Others see the death as the easily avoidable result of a movie star's allegedly unpredictable and complacent behavior.\"To watch Mr Baldwin's conduct on the set of 'Rust' is to witness a man who has absolutely no control of his own emotions and absolutely no concern for how his conduct affects those around him,\" special prosecutor Kari Morrissey has said.If found guilty, Baldwin faces up to 18 months in prison. It is not yet known if he plans to take the stand in his defense. Hutchins's death occurred almost three years ago, during a rehearsal in a small chapel on the Bonanza Creek Ranch, on a sunny afternoon mid-way through the filming of \"Rust.\"Baldwin was practicing a scene in which his character, an aging outlaw who has been cornered in the church by two marshals, draws his Colt six-shooter.The actor says he was told the gun was safe, was instructed by Hutchins to aim the revolver in her direction, and did not pull the trigger.Live bullets are in any case banned from movie sets, and Baldwin has said it was not his responsibility as an actor to check.Filming of \"Rust\" was halted by the tragedy, but completed last year on location in Montana.Earlier this year the film's armorer was convicted of manslaughter in the same courthouse, and sentenced to 18 months in prison.Her trial revealed arguments the prosecution will likely level against Baldwin.At the time, armorer Hannah Gutierrez's defense lawyers said Baldwin \"violated some of the most basic gun safety rules you can ever learn,\" including never pointing a gun at a person unless you intend to fire it.\"Alec Baldwin's conduct and his lack of gun safety inside that church on that day is something that he's going to have to answer for,\" responded Morrissey.\"Not with you and not today. That'll be with another jury, on another day.\"That day has now arrived.On Monday, Baldwin -- dressed in a dark suit and striped tie, wearing thick-rimmed glasses and with his hair clipped short -- observed as lawyers settled various pre-trial matters.In a boost for the defense, Judge Mary Marlowe Sommer ruled prosecutors cannot argue Baldwin's additional role as a producer on \"Rust\" makes him more culpable.But the case finally arriving in court is already a victory for prosecutors, who have fended off multiple attempts to have it dismissed.Among these, Baldwin's lawyers said damage to the gun caused by an FBI testing lab meant the actor could not get a fair trial.The FBI found the gun could not have fired without its trigger being pulled -- a conclusion the defense say they were robbed of a chance to disprove.The judge was not convinced, and ordered the trial to proceed.",

        "text": "Khloe Kardashian is glowing with motherly pride as she spends time with her children, whom she admits resemble two people. After Khloe shared two new photos with children True Thompson, 5, and Tatum Thompson, 13 months, on August 26, 2023, Kim Kardashian commented, \"I just can't handle it!!!!! You with Tristan Jr & Rob Jr.\" Khloe replied to Kim, \"Facts!!! Lol\" with a six-face crying-laughing emoji, per DailyMail. True looks much like her father, according to both the Good American founder and Tristan, who are co-parenting their children after their separation in 2021. On the other hand, the rest of the members of the Kardashian-Jenner family recently commented on Tatum's likeness to Rob Kardashian in public. After Tatum turned one in July, his grandma Kris Jenner sent a sweet message on social media: \"I'm honestly in awe of how you look exactly like Uncle Rob. It's wild and I love it!!!!\" Kim also concurred in a separate tweet, saying, \"You are Rob's twin! Your auntie loves you SO MUCH.\" Khloe then commented, \"Our Armenian boy.\" According to recent rumors, Khloe Kardashian \"hit the roof\" after learning that her sister Kim Kardashian had a party with her unfaithful ex-boyfriend. Kim, 42, and Tristan Thompson, 32, had dinner together in Miami this month. She brought her seven-year-old son Saint along to see Lionel Messi play in his first game for Inter Miami. Tristan joined SKIMS's founder at the game, and afterward, the two were seen eating supper at celebrity favorite Gekko and dancing the night away at LIV. Tristan, a father of four, shared an image of himself and Kim, who was blowing a kiss to the camera in the picture, later that night. According to InTouch's source, \"Khloe is devastated. But this time she's blaming her sister, not Tristan. It's humiliating to be sitting at home in LA, taking care of Tristan's kids, while her sister and her ex are out partying in public.\" The source continued, \"Kim wore a very sexy outfit to dinner \u2014 a black leather halter top and leather pants and heels. And Tristan wore a see-through black top and black pants. They matched perfectly and, frankly, looked like a couple.\" After Tristan's infidelity with another woman was exposed just before the birth of his second kid with Khloe through a surrogate, the two went their own ways last year. Kim and Tristan's meeting came amid speculation that Khloe forgave her ex-boyfriend and reconciled with him, despite him having fathered a child with another woman. Khloe let the Los Angeles Lakers player move back in with the family in January, which is just one of the many shocking discoveries in the new season of The Kardashians. Despite their apparent love chemistry, a source informed TMZ that they are not dating. According to the source, Khloe and Tristan \"are essentially operating as one parental unit\" as they raise their two young children together, True (now five) and Tatum (now ten months).",

        "text": "Conservative Gov. Koike Yuriko of Tokyo, Japan, won a third term in office on Sunday in a high-turnout election where her top rival was expected to be the candidate backed by the Japanese Communist Party \u2014 but instead came in third to a YouTube celebrity politician who moved to Tokyo a week before campaigning began. This year\u2019s gubernatorial race may be more remembered for the chaos of campaigning than the result of an incumbent winner, which occurs often in local Japanese politics. The race invited dozens of unusual candidates, ranging from one-issue political activists to bizarre performance artists to a man promising to replace all politicians with artificial intelligence. For the price of an official candidacy, Tokyo offers candidates reserved billboard space and several blocks of television on the public broadcaster NHK that they can use however they want. Many candidates took advantage of that for publicity, littering Tokyo with bizarre posters of cartoons and nude women and using their airtime for cosplay and general shouting. Tokyo residents complained that the race was \u201cdistasteful\u201d this year, lamenting that it had attracted confused attention from foreigners. Koike has been governor of Tokyo since 2016 and was once a member of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), which has also controlled the federal government of Japan with little opposition for most of the post-World War II era. Koike ran as an independent but with the support of the LDP, among several other conservative groups. The largest left-wing party in Japan, the Constitutional Democratic Party, backed Saito Renho, a popular former lawmaker who campaigned aggressively against the LDP, attempting to harness growing national disillusion with the party. Renho, who is commonly referred to by her first name, also received the support of the Communist Party and the Social Democratic Party, establishing her left-wing credentials. Early reports indicated that Renho\u2019s high profile and backing from major opposition groups in the country would make her the most promising challenger in a race that boasted an unprecedented 56 candidates. Japanese media buzzed with the development of a political race dominated by female politicians, a rarity in the male-dominated society. On Sunday, however, Renho came in third place. Ishimaru Shinji, the former mayor of the small town of Akitakata in Hiroshima prefecture, took second place. Ishimaru moved to Tokyo in June and resigned from the mayorship shortly before the gubernatorial race began in May. According to the major Japanese newspaper Asahi Shimbun, Koike won the election with 43 percent of the vote, far above second-place finisher Ishimaru, who obtained 24.3 percent of the vote. Renho came in third with 18.8 percent. Asahi attributed Koike\u2019s victory to \u201cstrong support from women and elderly voters,\u201d while younger voters who may be more inclined to vote against establishment-linked conservatives split their vote among several candidates. Ishimaru appeared to surpass Renho by tapping into independent voters, who greatly increased their turnout from the 2020 election. Ishimaru, local media noted, attracted voters by regularly uploading video screeds onto YouTube, where he developed a loyal following rapidly despite not being from Tokyo or apparently acquainted with local problems. Ishimaru promised to bring a fresh perspective to Tokyo politics independent of growing accusations against the LDP of mismanagement of party funding and focused on problems that residents grapple with more directly. Some experts suggested that condemning the LDP, which Koike is no longer a member of, did not appear to unify the LDP vote as it became a campaign strategy for several other alternatives. \u201cIt\u2019s a reason not to vote for Koike, but it\u2019s also a reason to vote for any of the 50-odd challengers,\u201d Kenneth McElwain, a political scientist at the University of Tokyo, told the left-wing New York Times. The Yomiuri Shimbun described Koike\u2019s victory as a reprieve for the LDP from an otherwise lamentable performance in other local elections on Sunday. The LDP lost six Tokyo by-election races on Sunday despite keeping the governor\u2019s office. \u201cThere are concerns within the LDP that Koike\u2019s victory was the result of the party\u2019s efforts to avoid having her being tarred by the party\u2019s brush, and that the party tough situation has not changed,\u201d Yomiuri reported. The LDP has for years benefitted from Japan not being home to an efficient left-wing political party or a coherent political left more generally. This was in some ways highlighted by the fact that, out of 56 candidates, 24 appeared on the ballot as part of the Party to Protect the People from NHK, a party founded to call for an end to NHK\u2019s licensing fees for television broadcasts. The NHK party is the source of much of this year\u2019s election chaos as its candidate registrations have \u201callowed photos of corgis, babies and influencers with QR codes linked to their social media accounts to be shown next to those of official candidates.\u201d The use of billboards became the first of several bizarre disputes in the election as the government prepared only 48 spaces for posters to be used by 56 candidates. The election commission handled the situation by asking candidates to tape their billboards to the side of the main billboard, expanding the spaces. The spaces rapidly became filled up by strange promotions that had little to do with traditional politics. Some candidates published photos of cartoons, cute animals, or dogs. The competition for space resulted in widespread vandalism as campaign workers destroyed or replaced their rivals\u2019 posters. One candidate \u2014 a perennial political fixture named Yusuke Kawai who appears in his political capacity dressed as either the Joker from the Batman comic books or the comic villain The Mask \u2014 displayed posters featuring a nearly nude woman, an alleged \u201cfree speech\u201d measure. Police issued him a warning and took the posters down. Kawai sucked up much of the public attention that may have gone to Renho or other candidates due to his outlandish style and his campaign platform. Most top candidates focused on Japan\u2019s growing birth rate crisis as a major campaign issue. All promised more financial support for parents and those considering having children, though they disagreed on the form that support would take. Kawai\u2019s solution to the problem is polygamy, which he promoted with posters in which he is featured surrounded by models. He also published promotional music videos on his YouTube page in which he appears at bars partying with women. These proved to be less popular than Ishimaru\u2019s political diatribes. Kawai\u2019s list of issues on his official social media profile include \u201cfreedom of expression,\u201d \u201cabolition of welfare for foreigners,\u201d outlawing euthanasia for animals, and lower taxes. During most his allotted official NHK time, he appeared in costume and screamed or laughed hysterically. Kawai got into a political feud with Matsuda Michihito, a candidate who ran under the title \u201cAI Mayor\u201d and called for eradicating all human governance. Like Kawai, AI Mayor is not a new project and appears to have first run in 2018. Matsuda Michihito, que concorria com a alcunha \"O Prefeito IA\", prometia usar intelig\u00eancia artificial para decis\u00f5es pol\u00edticas, mas enfrentava cr\u00edticas por suas associa\u00e7\u00f5es com figuras controversas e propostas question\u00e1veis. pic.twitter.com/FSJTdMsuqZ \u2014 Japonizando (@Japonizandobr) July 7, 2024 Another candidate, the NHK Party-affiliated small business owner Uchino Airi, used her allotted television time to strip on camera and ask viewers to add her on social media. Uchino defeated Kawai but did not overcome the zero percent vote threshold. \u201cThey are distasteful. As a Japanese citizen I feel embarrassed,\u201d one voter, identified as Mayumi Noda, told the Associated Press last week, lamenting that \u201cmany foreign visitors pass by those billboards and they must wonder what\u2019s going on.\u201d Follow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.",

        "text": "Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi arrived in Moscow on Monday for a two-day state visit that included a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin scheduled for Monday night. Debate over the intended significance of Modi\u2019s visit was rife in foreign policy circles on Monday. Officially, the Indian government said Modi was simply resuming a long-standing tradition of bilateral summits with Russia that was interrupted by first the Wuhan coronavirus pandemic and then Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. India has maintained cordial relations with Russia since the Cold War, upgrading to an official \u201cstrategic partnership\u201d with an agreement signed in 2000. The New York Times on Monday thought Modi wanted to signal his \u201cdetermination to stick to his own diplomatic path\u201d by hopping over to Moscow at a moment when the Western world is eager to isolate Putin and pressure him for peace. For his part, Putin could use Modi\u2019s visit to demonstrate that \u201cthe Kremlin continues to have a strong partnership with India, despite India\u2019s deepening relationship with the United States.\u201d India buys massive amounts of Russian oil at discount prices, an arrangement that has benefited both countries tremendously since the outbreak of the Ukraine war. Bloomberg News speculated that Modi and Putin needed to clean up some thorny issues in their bilateral relationship. India is especially worried about Russia getting closer to regional arch-rival China, which has probably done more to help Russia get through sanctions than even India\u2019s gigantic oil purchases. India\u2019s massive trade imbalance with Russia is also causing Modi some political trouble at home. Petr Topychkanov of the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute said that while Modi and Putin tout their close friendship in public, Putin might \u201cface questions from Modi about the increasingly close ties between Russia and China\u201d while the two leaders are \u201cbehind closed doors.\u201d Business Insider wondered if Modi was actively trying to irritate the United States and Europe by meeting with Putin at roughly the same time NATO is meeting in Washington to discuss the Ukraine crisis. \u201cIndia\u2019s engagement with Russia isn\u2019t a good look for the U.S., as it comes while Washington is trying to isolate Putin,\u201d Business Insider pointed out, quoting U.S. officials who said that point has been very delicately raised with the Indian government. Modi just came through a bruising election that saw him win a historic third term but with greatly reduced parliamentary power for his Bharatiya Janata Party. He has solid domestic political reasons for asserting his independence, and he might hope to use India\u2019s relationship with Russia as leverage to get a better deal from the U.S. as it seeks to woo India more firmly into its orbit and tries to displace Russia as India\u2019s top military supplier. A chummy visit with Putin could also be a way for Modi to let the Western world know that he will only accept so much criticism of India\u2019s internal affairs, including its human rights record. Human Rights Watch (HRW) on Monday said it was unseemly for Modi, as the head of a massive democracy, to grant the authoritarian war criminal Putin a much-needed shot of diplomatic legitimacy: Russia\u2019s toxic global standing has made it rare, these days, for leaders of major democratic powers like India to visit. So, when Modi visits Moscow, many Ukrainians may feel aggrieved if he fails to publicly acknowledge the atrocities and their suffering. The many Russians horrified by the Kremlin\u2019s abusive war may also feel betrayed. HRW chastised Modi by telling him to reflect on how Russia\u2019s attempt to conquer Ukraine resembles the colonial abuses perpetrated against India before it won independence from the United Kingdom in 1947, including Russia\u2019s plans to erase Ukraine\u2019s history and culture. On the other hand, HRW noted that Modi\u2019s administration has \u201clong discriminated against religious minorities, cracked down on civil society, and failed to uphold economic and social rights.\u201d Modi is well aware of these criticisms, and he has presided over major diplomatic rows with the United States and Canada over persecuting and, in some cases, allegedly assassinating Sikh separatists on foreign soil. Modi may find it useful to remind the Western world that he has at least one friend who will never lecture him about human rights. The Washington Post took the most pessimistic view of all on Monday, combining Modi\u2019s visit to Moscow with Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n\u2019s surprise visit to Beijing on the same day as signs of a \u201cmultipolar, non-Western world order\u201d emerging. Although Modi could not have planned it that way, the symbolism of his arrival in Moscow just hours after a vicious Russian missile attack on Kyiv and other major Ukrainian cities was potent. Orb\u00e1n himself paid a visit to Moscow last week, enraging European leaders who said he was sending \u201cthe wrong signal to the outside world,\u201d as Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson put it. Modi is sending much the same message, and both of them are playing into China and Russia\u2019s argument that Western powers cannot negotiate peace in Ukraine.",

        "text": "Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said on Sunday he plans to invite Syrian dictator Bashar Assad to visit Ankara and mend relations that were strained by Turkey\u2019s support for rebel groups during the long and bloody Syrian civil war. \u201cWe will extend our invitation to Assad,\u201d Erdogan said during an interview with Turkish media. \u201cWith this invitation, we want to restore Turkey-Syria relations to the same level as in the past. Our invitation may be extended at any time,\u201d he said. Erdogan did not explain why he did not simply invite Assad to visit now, instead of talking about the wonderful invitation he plans to extend at some point in the very near future. \u201cWe have now arrived at a point where if Bashar Assad takes a step towards improving relations with Turkey, we will also show that approach towards him,\u201d the Turkish president said, hinting that he expects Assad to make some sort of opening move. Erdogan said Assad would be smart to pick up that phone soon because the region is supposedly beginning to respect Turkey\u2019s stature as a diplomatic power. \u201cPutin and the Iraqi prime minister have an approach for talks to be in Turkey. We are talking about mediation everywhere, why not with our neighbor?\u201d he said. Erdogan met with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Astana, Kazakhstan, on the sidelines of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) summit last Wednesday. Putin was amusingly curt in dismissing Erdogan\u2019s effusive offers to serve as a broker for Russia-Ukraine peace talks. On Monday, the Kremlin put a little ice on Erdogan\u2019s bruises by telling Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan that Russia would love to have a \u201cpeace platform\u201d somewhere, and Turkey would be as good a host as any. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peksov claimed Moscow has \u201cnever refused to negotiate,\u201d although the Kremlin\u2019s response to Erdogan\u2019s offer of mediation was literally \u201cno, it\u2019s not possible\u201d \u2014 and Peskov himself delivered it. \u201cOn the contrary, we have always favored negotiations involving all interested parties. While there is no such platform currently, you can only agree with Mr. Fidan on this point,\u201d Peskov claimed on Monday after meeting with the Turkish foreign minister. Erdogan and Assad have been doing a weird little dance around getting together and patching up their differences ever since the beginning of this year, with each of the authoritarian leaders urging the other to make the first move. Erdogan began hinting that he wanted better relations with Damascus after his party suffered a humiliating election defeat in April. Two weeks ago, Assad said he was \u201copen\u201d to mending ties with Turkey, provided the Turkish government adopts Syria\u2019s views on \u201csovereignty, territorial integrity in its entirety, the fight against terrorism, and terrorist organization.\u201d In other words, Assad wants Erdogan to stop supporting Syrian opposition groups and get Turkish troops off Syrian soil. Turkey has invaded Syria several times to push Kurdish militia groups back from the border, and Erdogan threatened to do it again only a few months ago. The Turkish government regards all Kurdish armed groups as extensions of the PKK, the violent Kurdish separatist party in Turkey. Erdogan said exactly one year ago that he would not agree to meet with Assad if he demanded unilateral withdrawal of Turkish forces from Syria as a precondition for talks. Assad emphasis last week on Turkey recognizing his \u201csovereignty\u201d implied he still has that precondition in mind. Reuters reported on Monday that Syrian refugees in Turkey are terrified that Erdogan and Assad will get together and settle their differences because Erdogan might decide to force them all back to Syria and let Assad have his way with them. Turkey hosts more Syrian refugees than any other country and many Turks are losing patience with them. Violence against Syrian refugees is reportedly rising, but even so, human rights activists say Turkey is still much safer for the refugees than Syria. The government of Iraq has suggested it might host meetings between Turkey and Syria, but it has not set a date or indicated whether it expects Erdogan and Assad to attend in person. \u201cWe are doing what is necessary, and the remaining details require extensive discussions with the concerned parties,\u201d the office of Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani said on Sunday.",

        "text": "By Akash Sriram (Reuters) -Lucid Group reported second-quarter deliveries above market expectations on Monday, as price cuts helped boost demand for its luxury electric sedans. Demand for electric vehicles has grown at a slower-than-expected pace in the past year, pressured by high borrowing costs, economic uncertainties and consumer preference for hybrid alternatives. EV market leader Tesla and others, including Lucid, have responded by slashing prices and offering incentives such as cheaper financing options to lure consumers. Lucid, shares of which rose about 4% on Monday, had cut prices of its flagship Air sedans by as much as 10% in February. The EV firm produced 3,838 vehicles in the first half of 2024 and needs to make more than 5,162 cars by the year-end to meet its annual output forecast of 9,000 units. It had made 8,428 vehicles in 2023. \"I think at this point, everything is shaping for them to achieve that guidance,\" Andres Sheppard, senior equity analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald, said. Lucid will produce and deliver more cars in the second half of the year, consistent with the automotive industry due to seasonal effects, he added. The company delivered 2,394 vehicles in the quarter ended June 30, above estimates of 1,940 units, according to eight analysts polled by Visible Alpha. Rivian Automotive reported upbeat second-quarter deliveries last week, while Tesla posted a smaller-than-expected decline. Lucid, in which Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund holds a 60% stake, had said in May it expects capital expenditure of $1.5 billion in 2024, up from $910.6 million last year, as it prepares to start manufacturing its Gravity SUV. The Gravity SUV, priced at around $80,000, is set to go into production later this year and will take on Tesla's Model X. Lucid's Air sedan competes against the Elon Musk-led EV maker's popular Model S. Lucid is set to report its quarterly results on Aug. 5.

The outlet based its calculations on publicly disclosed information.Many of the tycoons who received the dividend windfall are closely tied to Russian President Vladimir Putin, according to the news outlet. Some of them have been sanctioned by the West.The biggest winners from the dividend payouts were commodities exporters that have benefited from Russia's pivot of its trade eastward toward China, India, and other countries in the global south. Their key customers were previously from Europe.The biggest winner was Vagit Alekperov, a key shareholder and former president of oil giant Lukoil, who received 186 billion rubles in dividends, per Bloomberg. He has been sanctioned by the UK and Australia.Alexey Mordashov, chairman and a main shareholder of steel company Severstal, pocketed 148 billion rubles in dividends. The US, the UK, and the EU have sanctioned him.Meanwhile, Vladimir Lisin, the chairman of Novolipetsk Steel, raked in 121 billion rubles in dividends.The payouts illustrate how Russia's biggest companies are still profiting despite the West's isolation of the country's economy, which grew 5.4% in the first quarter of this year from a year ago.Russia's war-driven economy is so hot that the World Bank upgraded it to a \"high-income country\" last week.However, Russia's Center for Macroeconomic Analysis and Short-Term Forecasting \u2014 a key think tank \u2014 warned the country's economy could cool and slip into crisis in the second half of this year should the Bank of Russia hike interest rates, reported Kommersant, a business news outlet, on Monday.Elvira Nabiullina, Russia's central bank chief, has signaled an interest-rate hike ahead due to higher-than-expected inflation.Russia's key interest rate is already at 16% to cool price rises, but inflation hit 8.3% in May \u2014 well above the official 4% target.",

        "text": "Throughout its history, Russia has rarely cared for its soldiers, on or off the battlefield. The Kremlin\u2019s current attempt to do right by its veterans looks to be simultaneously insufficient and unaffordable, destined to leave behind armies of broken men while draining state coffers. After nearly two and a half years of grinding warfare, both Ukraine and Russia have taken horrendous casualties and spent hundreds of billions of dollars. Despite such a price, the conflict is unlikely to end soon, with both sides believing they have more to gain. This price is not just paid on the battlefield. Even if the fighting were to end today, the economic and demographic impact felt by the Russians would be generation-shaping. Through open source information on the costs of health care and the state of the Russian medical system, alongside historical scholarship and medical publications, we examine the crushing economic damage of the war on Russia from the lens of military personnel. We conclude that the state is logistically, fiscally, and culturally unprepared for the tremendous burden of supporting veterans and their families, presenting serious questions about state capacity going forward. Above all else, the Russian state has to financially support the families of fallen soldiers in perpetuity. Many of the wounded (to say nothing of the dead) will permanently be out of the workforce, and even those who return to it will require lifelong mental and physical health care. And the numbers of dead or wounded servicemembers will only worsen the negative demographic trends in Russia. These challenges will grow larger as the war continues and the bodies pile up. Holding aside the long-term implications of the personnel costs of the conflict, one has to appreciate how much the Russian state is currently spending to care for casualties. The one-time costs of compensating wounded and dead soldiers plus their families are very high, in no small part due to recent decrees that promise major payouts to incentivize volunteers. A law passed before the war entitles the family of a soldier who has been killed to 3.3 million rubles as an insurance payment from private insurers, and an additional 5 million rubles from the state. Wounded soldiers are entitled to 3 million rubles, as per a decree from the early days of the invasion of Ukraine. President Vladimir Putin has announced a separate 5 million ruble payment to families (this combines the previously mentioned 3 million ruble payout for injury with an additional 2 million in case of death). Every Russian oblast or province provides a separate payment of at least 1 million rubles, with some paying up to 3 million. Combining all of the above, the cost of payouts to the family of a soldier killed in Ukraine would come to at least 14 million rubles at the time of writing, excluding several smaller, long-term payments. Based on open source estimates from the governments of France and the United Kingdom as of May 2024, the Russians have likely taken around 400,000 casualties, with over 100,000 of those dead. Simple math shows that one-time payments would equate to 900 billion rubles for wounded personnel and at least 1.4 trillion for families of the dead, 2.3 trillion rubles total. This equates to 6 percent of the 2024 budget, a truly staggering amount that will continue to climb. Unfortunately for the Kremlin, it will not get off the hook with one-time expenses, at least if it wants to provide an adequate level of medical care for veterans. If anything, caring for wounded troops will be more difficult now than in the past; after Afghanistan and Chechnya, care was cheaper than today as the scope of treatment was narrower and the cost of medical equipment, drugs, and labor was lower. Physically, Russia\u2019s wounded are returning with complex, long-term injuries. Russia\u2019s deputy minister of labor himself reported that the majority of disabled veterans have at least one amputation. Mental wounds may be even more daunting to treat. A 2022 study carried out by researchers from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs estimated that the total economic cost of post-traumatic stress disorder, society-wide, in the United States was $232 billion in 2018. Approximately 80 percent of those with post-traumatic stress were civilians, while 20 percent were servicemembers. The annual, per-person cost of post-traumatic stress disorder in military personnel and veterans was $25,700 per year, and the same figure was $18,640 per year for civilians. Adjusted for inflation, those same figures would be approximately $32,000 and $23,000 a year. Applying this research to the Russian case, if we divide these costs by purchasing power parity, which compares different countries\u2019 cost of living, we get an approximate estimate of the cost of post-traumatic stress disorder. The purchasing power parity modifier for Russia is roughly 2.2, meaning that goods and services worth $100 in the United States would cost roughly $45 in Russia. Using this, we estimate the yearly cost of treating a soldier with post-traumatic stress disorder in Russia to be approximately $15,000. Assuming the dollar-to-ruble exchange rate remains constant at 90 rubles to the dollar, this would be 1.35 million rubles per year, per individual. If one million soldiers end up serving in the invasion of Ukraine, 500,000 of them could reasonably be expected to acquire some sort of post-traumatic stress disorder based on historical estimates. If so, the estimated yearly cost to the Russian economy of post-traumatic stress disorder among Ukraine veterans would be over 660 billion rubles a year, roughly 2 percent of the 2024 budget. Holding aside the staggering costs of treating veterans in Russia, there are also significant capacity issues that the Russians are woefully ill equipped to deal with. The number of hospitals in Russia has declined roughly 20 percent since 2012, and there are only 10 veterans\u2019 hospitals in the country. The only one that focuses on psychological rehabilitation has just 32 beds. There will need to be a massive expansion of the Russian military hospital system, or the state risks the collapse of the medical system, particularly in poorer and more sparsely populated areas. It\u2019s unclear where the money and personnel for such an expansion would come from. Yet, if the state does not disburse the required resources, then either Russian veterans or the citizenry will not get adequate medical care. There is no middle ground. Further, Russian policymakers seem unwilling to assess if post-traumatic stress disorder is even an issue, since, according to grassroots veteran organizations and veterans themselves, \u201cno one tests veterans for psychological trauma\u201d and \u201cthere are no rehabilitation programs.\u201d Instead of funding central treatment centers, the Russian government is supposed to provide grants to support groups or various programs set up by former soldiers, yet funding is sparse. The Kremlin ordered the creation of the \u201cDefenders of the Fatherland Foundation\u201d in June 2023, and the organization has reportedly opened branches in several regions, including St. Petersburg. Government claims that the foundation has helped thousands of people seem dubious, as only 3 percent of its budget is dedicated to actually treating psychological ailments. The total first quarterly budget for the foundation was a mere 1.3 billion rubles ($15\u2013$20 million under current exchange rates), for what is supposedly a national organization. Even when volunteers overcome funding challenges to care for veterans, additional roadblocks have been encountered. For example, there are cases where volunteer medical staff are not allowed into St. Petersburg hospitals, and volunteers must fight the government tooth and nail to distribute aid. This may be part of an attempt to limit the exposure of civilians to the real effects of Putin\u2019s war. Even with government-run organizations, access to aid is held up by rampant incompetence and bureaucracy. The wife of a veteran, seeking help from the Defenders of the Fatherland Foundation, was told that her amputee husband had to personally appear to file a claim to initiate the process of receiving treatment. Whether due to a lack of resources or to a view of post-traumatic stress disorder as a personal weakness, it appears highly likely that huge numbers of traumatized veterans will not receive adequate mental health treatment upon their return. This will only be compounded by aspects of Russian society, such as the interrogation of veteran organization medical volunteers, who were summoned by security forces to an investigative committee for \u201cundermining\u201d the Russian Ministry of Defense. A 2009 study examined those who had endured traumatic experiences during the Yugoslav wars and who had never accessed psychological treatment. The results reveal the drastic impact of untreated trauma on productivity. At the time of the study, respondents universally reported extremely high unemployment. Of the participants who lived in Croatia, 43 percent were unemployed, at a time when the Croatian unemployment rate was under 10 percent. Participants in Serbia reported a 55 percent unemployment rate, those living in the United Kingdom a 50 percent rate, and those in Germany, 85 percent. While it would not be appropriate to say this relationship will be exactly reproduced in Russia, it clearly demonstrates the disastrous impacts untreated post-traumatic stress disorder can have on an individual\u2019s ability to function in society. Traumatized veterans who do not receive care can be expected to have vastly lower employment rates and lean much more heavily on government benefits, further weakening the Russian economy in the decades to come. While we focused our discussion on the costs of post-traumatic stress disorder in terms of cost of care and lower productivity, there are plentiful cases of other negative effects. For example, up to 60 percent of Soviet veterans of the Afghan war suffered from alcoholism or drug addiction in November 1989. The Serbsky Center estimated in 2003 that 70 percent of veterans from the two Chechen Wars had some form of post-traumatic stress disorder. By the mid-2000s, about 100,000 veterans of \u201clocal wars\u201d (primarily Chechnya) were in prison. Using budgetary data taken from Russian journalists, the state would be spending 10 billion rubles a year jailing local war veterans. Given the precedents set in the Afghan and Chechen wars of ignoring or severely underfunding mental health care, there is a serious possibility that this will be repeated with the invasion of Ukraine. Old attitudes that see mental illness as moral and spiritual weakness likely remain strong among leadership. Such attitudes are very likely to have sway among Russian soldiers, making them less likely to seek out treatment. As we have also noted, the kind of frank and open discussions about the war that are a part of coping with trauma may be seen as undermining public confidence in the military. All this means that if and when money becomes scarcer in Russia (especially if oil prices drop), mental health programs might be early on the chopping block. The figures here are not exhaustive, and the true costs of veteran care will likely be higher. Even still, they demonstrate the tremendous burden that the war in Ukraine will exact on Russia after the guns go quiet. Treating post-traumatic stress disorder, caring for physically wounded soldiers, and supporting their families will become either a major budget item for decades to come, or a political weakness for the government if it fails to satisfy the expectations of veterans and families. In the long term, heightened expenditures, coupled with unstable revenues, will force the Russian state to make difficult choices.

        "text": "Meghan Trainor has a trick for potty training her son and it involves answering nature's call together.In an interview with Dax Shepard on his podcast \"Armchair Expert\" on Monday, the \"Made You Look\" singer shared her potty training method while discussing anal fissures.\"We're potty training my kid, so don't attack me internet, but I pooped with him,\" Trainor, 30, told Shepard. \"He was on his little potty, and I was over here. I know I can smell my poop, but we were like, 'We did it, buddy!'\"This is not the first time Trainor has brought up toilet talk. In 2021, she was interviewed with her brother Ryan Trainor on the \"Why Won't You Date Me?\" podcast hosted by Nicole Byer. \"They poop together. She's pooping and Daryl's like, 'I'm going to go hang out with you now!'\" Ryan said about his sister and her husband on the show.Trainor told Byer that she and her husband, actor Daryl Sabara, had installed two toilet bowls side by side in their house. The setup has also helped ease nighttime parenting duties. \"Because we have young babies, so we're getting up every hour on the hour, and this dude pees like a girl. So I was like, get out of my way, I have to piss,\" she told Shepard. \"So I solved this crime, and I was like, we're gonna pee at the same time.\"She clarified, however, that their shared bathroom time was limited to peeing.Trainor and Sabara married in December 2018 after dating for almost two years. They welcomed their son, Riley, in February 2021 and their second son, Barry Bruce, in July 2023.Since then, Trainor has been open about motherhood and parenting, including developing post-traumatic stress disorder after the complicated birth of her first son.Trainor is not the only celebrity sharing her potty training methods. In 2020, actor Kristen Bell said in her podcast \"Momsplaining with Kristen Bell\" that when her older daughter was 21 months, she and her husband, Dax Shepard, had simply suggested she use the toilet.\"We were lying in bed giggling about this, my husband and I, like, 'Why does everyone make a big deal out of this potty training? It's so easy. Just tell the kid to use the toilet,'\" she said.She went on to explain that it wasn't as easy with her younger daughter, who was still wearing diapers at 5.While methods for potty training vary, Paul Patterson, MD, a board-certified pediatrician, told Business Insider that potty training should be tailored to each child's needs.\"Each child and family is unique and thus so must the approach be to potty training,\" he said.",

        "text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 In the third year of the war in Ukraine, NATO is set to deepen relations with its four Indo-Pacific partners, which, although not part of the military alliance, are gaining prominence as Russia and China forge closer ties to counter the United States and the two Koreas support opposing sides of the conflict in Europe. The leaders of New Zealand, Japan and South Korea for the third year in a row will attend the NATO summit, which starts Tuesday in Washington, D.C., while Australia will send its deputy prime minister. China will be following the summit closely, worried by the alliance\u2019s growing interest beyond Europe and the Western Hemisphere. \u201cIncreasingly, partners in Europe see challenges halfway around the world in Asia as being relevant to them, just as partners in Asia see challenges halfway around the world in Europe as being relevant to them,\u201d Secretary of State Antony Blinken said last week at the Brookings Institution. America\u2019s top diplomat said the U.S. has been working to break down barriers between European alliances, Asian coalitions and other partners worldwide. \u201cThat\u2019s part of the new landscape, the new geometry that we\u2019ve put in place.\u201d Countries with shared security concerns are strengthening ties as competition escalates between the United States and China. Washington is trying to curb Beijing\u2019s ambition to challenge the U.S.-led world order, which the Chinese government dismisses as a Cold War mentality aimed at containing China\u2019s inevitable rise. On Monday, Beijing responded angrily to unconfirmed reports that NATO and its four Indo-Pacific partners are expected to release a document laying out their relationship and ability to respond jointly to threats from cyberattacks and disinformation. Lin Jian, a spokesman for the Chinese foreign ministry, accused NATO of \u201cbreaching its boundary, expanding its mandate, reaching beyond its defense zone and stoking confrontation.\u201d The war in Ukraine, which has pitted the West against Russia and its friends, has bolstered the argument for closer cooperation between the U.S., Europe and their Asian allies. \u201cUkraine of today may be East Asia of tomorrow,\u201d Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida told the U.S. Congress in April. The U.S. and South Korea accused Pyongyang of supplying Russia with ammunition, while Russian President Vladimir Putin visited North Korea last month and signed a pact with leader Kim Jong Un that envisions mutual military assistance. South Korea and Japan, meanwhile, are sending military supplies and aid to Ukraine. The U.S. also says China is providing Russia with machine tools, microelectronics and other technology that allow it to make weapons to use against Ukraine. South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol will bring to Washington \u201ca strong message regarding the military cooperation between Russia and North Korea and discuss ways to enhance cooperation among NATO allies and Indo-Pacific partners,\u201d his principal deputy national security adviser, Kim Tae-hyo, told reporters Friday. New Zealand Prime Minister Christopher Luxon said discussions would \u201cfocus on our collective efforts to support the rules-based system.\u201d The partnership does not make NATO a direct player in the Indo-Pacific but allows it to coordinate with the four partners on issues of mutual concern, said Mirna Galic, senior policy analyst on China and East Asia at the U.S. Institute of Peace. For example, she wrote in an analysis, they can share information and align on actions such as sanctions and aid delivery but do not intervene in military crises outside of their own regions. The NATO summit will allow the United States and its European and Indo-Pacific allies to push back against China, Russia, North Korea and Iran, according to Luis Simon, director of the Centre for Security Diplomacy and Strategy at Vrije Universiteit Brussel. \u201cThe fact that the Euro-Atlantic and Indo-Pacific alliances are structured around a clear anchor \u2014 U.S. military power \u2014 makes them more cohesive and gives them a strategic edge as compared to the sort of interlocking partnerships that bind China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea,\u201d Simon wrote in a commentary last week on War On the Rocks, a defense and foreign affairs website. Beijing is worried by NATO\u2019s pivot to the east, said Zhu Feng, dean of the School of International Studies at Nanjing University in eastern China. Beijing has insisted that NATO not interfere in security affairs in the Indo-Pacific and that it should change its view of China as a strategic adversary. \u201cNATO should consider China as a positive force for the regional peace and stability and for global security,\u201d Zhu said. \u201cWe also hope the Ukraine war can end as soon as possible ... and we have rejected a return to the triangular relation with Russia and North Korea.\u201d \u201cIn today\u2019s volatile and fragile world, Europe, the U.S. and China should strengthen global and regional cooperation,\u201d Zhu said. NATO and China had little conflict until tensions grew between Beijing and Washington in 2019, the same year the NATO summit in London raised China as a \u201cchallenge\u201d that \u201cwe need to address together as an alliance.\u201d Two years later, NATO upgraded China to a \u201csystemic challenge\u201d and said Beijing was \u201ccooperating militarily with Russia.\u201d After Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, leaders of Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand attended a NATO summit for the first time, where statements noted the geopolitical challenges China poses. Beijing accused NATO of \u201ccooperating with the U.S. government for an all-around suppression of China.\u201d Now, Beijing is worried that Washington is forming a NATO-like alliance in the Indo-Pacific. Chinese Senior Col. Cao Yanzhong, a researcher at China\u2019s Institute of War Studies, asked U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin last month whether the U.S. was trying to create an Asian version of NATO by emphasizing partnerships and alliances. They include a U.S. grouping with Britain and Australia; another with Australia, India and Japan; and one with Japan and South Korea. \u201cWhat implications do you think the strengthening of the U.S. alliance system in the Asia-Pacific will have on this region\u2019s security and stability?\u201d Cao asked at the Shangri-la Dialogue security summit in Singapore. Austin replied that the U.S. was simply working with \u201clike-minded countries with similar values and a common vision of a free and open Indo-Pacific.\u201d Beijing has its own conclusion. \u201cThe real intent of the U.S. Indo-Pacific strategy is to integrate all small circles into a big circle as the Asian version of NATO in order to maintain the hegemony as led by the United States,\u201d Chinese Lt. Gen. Jing Jianfeng said at the forum. AP researcher Chen Wanqing in Beijing contributed to this report.",

        "text": "TAIPEI, Taiwan \u2014 Chinese President Xi Jinping called on world powers to help Russia and Ukraine resume direct dialogue during a meeting Monday with Hungary\u2019s Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n, state broadcaster CCTV reported. Orb\u00e1n made a surprise visit to China after similar trips last week to Russia and Ukraine to discuss prospects for a peaceful settlement of more than the two-year war. Hungary assumed the rotating presidency of the European Union this month and Orb\u00e1n has since embarked on a peace mission, which, however, lacks the endorsement of other European leaders. \u201cChina is a key power in creating the conditions for peace in the Russia-Ukraine war,\u201d Orb\u00e1n wrote on the social media platform X. \u201cThis is why I came to meet with President Xi in Beijing, just two months after his official visit to Budapest.\u201d Orb\u00e1n is widely seen as having the warmest relations with Xi and Russian President Vladimir Putin among European leaders. His visit to Moscow last week drew condemnation from Kyiv and EU officials, who insisted Orb\u00e1n was not acting on behalf of the whole European bloc. Their rebuke failed to deter Orb\u00e1n from extending a similar visit to Beijing, which he called \u201cPeace mission 3.0\u201d in a picture posted on X. During his meeting with Xi, Orb\u00e1n described China as a stabilizing force amid global turbulence and praised its \u201cconstructive and important\u201d peace initiatives. China has been promoting its own six-point peace plan, which it issued with Brazil in May. Beijing says it is neutral in the conflict, though in practice it supports Moscow through frequent state visits, growing trade and joint military drills. While hosting Orb\u00e1n, Xi called on Russia and Ukraine to cease fire and on other major powers to create an environment conducive to talks. Only when all major powers project \u201cpositive energy rather than negative energy\u201d can a cease-fire occur, Xi said, according to CCTV. Orb\u00e1n hosted the Chinese leader in Hungary only two months ago as part of a three-country European tour that also included stops in France and Serbia, which unlike the other two is not a member of the EU or NATO. During the trip, China upgraded its ties with Hungary to an \u201call-weather, comprehensive strategic partnership,\u201d one of its highest designations for foreign relations that in addition to Hungary applies only to Belarus, Pakistan and Venezuela. Hungary under Orb\u00e1n has built substantial political and economic ties with China. The European nation hosts a number of Chinese electric vehicle battery facilities, and in December it announced that Chinese EV manufacturing giant BYD will open its first European EV production factory in the south of the country. The Hungarian prime minister broadly opposes Western military aid to Ukraine and has blocked, delayed or watered down EU efforts to assist Kyiv and impose sanctions on Moscow over its invasion. Orb\u00e1n has long argued for a cessation of hostilities in Ukraine but without outlining what that might mean for the country\u2019s territorial integrity or future security. That posture has frustrated Hungary\u2019s EU and NATO allies, who have denounced Russia\u2019s invasion as a breach of international law and a threat to the security of Eastern Europe. \u201cWith Europe trying to increasingly speak with one voice in its relations to China and Russia, Orb\u00e1n\u2019s unannounced and uncoordinated trips are not helping in signaling or creating a unified European Union with regard to EU-China relations,\u201d said Eva Seiwert, a China foreign policy and security expert with the Mercator Institute for China Studies in Berlin. Orb\u00e1n\u2019s proposals for resolving the war largely correspond with Putin\u2019s interests, Seiwert added, though the Hungarian prime minister might prove helpful in organizing a peace conference in the future. Standing alongside Orb\u00e1n last week in Moscow, Putin declared that Russia wouldn\u2019t accept any cease-fire or temporary break in hostilities that would allow Ukraine \u201cto recoup losses, regroup and rearm.\u201d Putin repeated his demand that Ukraine withdraw its troops from the four regions that Moscow claims to have annexed in 2022 as a condition for any prospective peace talks. Ukraine and its Western allies have rejected that demand, suggesting it is akin to asking Kyiv to withdraw from its own territory. China meanwhile has spread its influence in Central Asia and Eastern Europe in recent years beyond its \u201cno limits\u201d partnership with Moscow. Over the weekend, China held \u201canti-terror\u201d military drills with Belarus \u2014 a key ally of Russia \u2014 near the border with Poland. The drills came after last week Belarus joined a regional security organization led by China and Russia. Orb\u00e1n will next head to Washington, D.C., where NATO leaders are holding a summit to discuss ways to assure Ukraine of the alliance\u2019s continued support. \u201cNext stop: Washington,\u201d Orb\u00e1n posted on his social media account Monday. It was not clear whether he would meet separately with President Joe Biden, or Donald Trump, whose presidential candidacy Orb\u00e1n openly supports. Associated Press writers Adam Schreck in Bangkok, Justin Spike in Budapest, Hungary, and Vladimir Isachenkov in Moscow contributed to this report.",

        "text": "Russia is continuing to lose high numbers of equipment in Vladimir Putin's war in Ukraine, according to Kyiv's latest figures, which outlined a significant milestone in destroyed and captured artillery.The Ukrainian defense ministry said on Tuesday that over the previous 24 hours, Russian forces had lost 49 pieces of artillery, taking the total losses for the equipment since the start of the war on February 24, 2022, to just over 15,000. Just over a week into July, Kyiv's estimate of Russian artillery losses is already 416, which is on track to beat the monthly record of 1,415 from June.In the first year of the war, artillery losses hovered at around 200 per month, but there has been a spike in these numbers, particularly over the last nine months, and monthly tallies of over 700 have been common.May's figure of 1,160 saw the tally exceed four figures for the first time\u2014well clear of the previous highest of 947 in September 2023. Kyiv's highest tally of artillery losses for a day so far is 89 on May 3, 2024.Newsweek contacted the Russian defense ministry for comment.For comparison, the tracker website Oryx, which uses verifiable imagery as evidence and says the real number is \"significantly higher,\" counted losses of towed artillery of 380 as of Tuesday. This consisted of 228 pieces being destroyed, 52 damaged, five abandoned and 95 captured.Oryx also said that Russia had faced self-propelled artillery losses of 779, of which 621 were destroyed, 45 damaged: five abandoned and 108 captured.Russia's daily troop losses also continue to be high, according to Kyiv, which said on Tuesday had reached 553,410 following casualties of 1,220 the previous day. Ukraine's estimate of casualties includes those injured and killed.Last week, independent Russian media outlets Mediazona and Meduza gave \"flash estimates\" of Russian deaths by analyzing databases of inheritance cases and comparing the trends with mortality data from Russia's State Statistics Service, the Russian Probate Registry and obituaries.Using these criteria, the project said that as of the end of June, around 120,000 Russian troops had been killed in the war, although the real number may be as high as 140,000.A separate count by Mediazona and BBC News Russian drawing on publicly available information such as obituaries, social media posts and regional media reports found that the number of Russian troops killed was 58,207.Russia hasn't updated its official figures of just under 6,000 troop losses in September 2022.Neither Kyiv nor Moscow releases detailed casualty numbers, although Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said in February 2024 that 31,000 Ukrainian troops had been killed.Last month, Putin claimed that Ukraine had lost five times as many troops as Russia, without providing proof. The claim runs counter to Ukrainian and U.S. battlefield estimates that Moscow has suffered many more casualties than Kyiv.",

        "text": "The concept of The Boyfriend, Japan\u2019s first same-sex reality show, is not unfamiliar: a group of nine gay men live in a house together for a month. The goal? To forge lifelong friendships and to find the man of their dreams. Unlike other shows, the guys (ranging from ages 22 to 36) aren\u2019t stuck on set with no access to the outside world\u2014there are numerous occasions where work and other obligations mean that some guys leave the house for days at a time. That\u2019s a small detail that\u2019s more about Japan\u2019s strict working culture than anything else, but it adds a dash of actual reality to the mix, delivering an idea of what life would be like dating someone with a busy job. There are no eliminations or alliances. The closest thing to a traditional reality TV \u201cchallenge\u201d is that they all run a coffee truck together. Each day someone new is in charge and gets to choose one of the other guys to work with them, in a bid to forge a stronger connection. That came as a shock to me, as someone whose understanding of Japanese shows comes largely from parodies of their game shows on American shows like SNL, Family Guy, and The Simpsons. But I was blown away by The Boyfriend, which feels so lived-in and natural that it makes most American TV look like the most outrageously overproduced nonsense you\u2019ve ever seen. Honestly, you\u2019ve never experienced anything quite like The Boyfriend\u2014it\u2019s like the coziest, most wholesome television you can\u2019t stop watching. Though it\u2019s a reality show, it lacks a lot of the familiar hallmarks of the genre. The most immediate difference is the lack of music. You won\u2019t find a heavy dose of pop music and an endless buffet of musical cues to whip up tension and steer your emotions. The Boyfriend is more invested in the everyday lives of the guys on the show than whipping up drama. In fact, it doesn\u2019t feel particularly engineered at all\u2014even if, by virtue of being a reality series, it obviously is to some extent. There are, of course, produced elements: new guys slowly trickle into the house, and there are twists that force the guys to anonymously profess their feelings for someone else in the house. But it feels more like an examination of how gay men live openly in Japan and what their lives look like as queer people than anything else, and it\u2019s a joy to behold. What\u2019s most remarkable about The Boyfriend is the show\u2019s approach to sex and love. There\u2019s a relentless horniness to popular dating shows like Love Island, whatever the hell MILF Manor is doing, and Netflix\u2019s own Perfect Match and Too Hot To Handle. While the desire for love is certainly key to The Boyfriend, the sex aspect is massively dialed back. In fact, after three episodes, there hasn\u2019t even been a kiss on the show, let alone anything racier. This is hugely refreshing. There\u2019s nothing wrong with sex\u2014it rules!\u2014but as hook-up culture and dating via apps become more and more prevalent, it\u2019s charming to see something so defiantly different. There\u2019s nothing wrong with a one-night stand or jumping right into sexual activity. Still, there\u2019s something to be said for getting to know someone before jumping into the physical aspects of a relationship. Also unlike the majority of reality dating series, it doesn\u2019t seem like anyone on The Boyfriend is on the show to launch a career as a celebrity/influencer. These boys are here for a reason: to make connections and find a home in the queer community, and ultimately a man to love. Nobody is here to intentionally stir things up, flip tables, or turn people against each other for attention. There\u2019s an earnestness to everyone\u2019s intentions that makes this feel like nothing else on reality TV. This goes a long way to making the slow, lived-in pace of The Boyfriend feel natural. There\u2019s something enticing about taking your time and figuring out who the right match is for you. These guys are in a house together for an entire month, there\u2019s no need to rush! There\u2019s a calmness to the conversations, which are refreshingly genuine as the guys open up about past loves, their expectations and reasons for being on the show, and what they\u2019re looking for in a relationship and partner. The key relationship in the first three episodes is between Shun (23) and Dai (22). There\u2019s a mutual attraction, but things are complicated when Shun accidentally sees Dai\u2019s nudes on his phone. It makes Shun question Dai\u2019s intentions: Is Dai just a \u201cplayer,\u201d or really here for love? That feels surprising\u2014having nudes on your phone is incredibly common\u2014yet also reveals a sort of innocence that we don\u2019t witness on most reality shows. When you accidentally see something you don\u2019t want to see, how do you navigate those emotions? The Boyfriend successfully captures that electric feeling of falling in love for the first time. The show is full of that familiar kinetic nervous energy; there\u2019s just as much excitement that comes from a brushing of the knee or a hug as there would be in more explicit acts. The focus through the first three episodes of The Boyfriend is on forging meaningful connections, which surprisingly makes for some seriously spicy television. It\u2019s a reminder that love doesn\u2019t have to start with a hookup\u2014though hey, it certainly can! Netflix is smartly rolling out The Boyfriend in weekly installments. And after the rather shocking end of Episode 3 (I won\u2019t spoil it here, but please go watch!), I can\u2019t wait to see how the rest of the series turns out.",

        "text": "How often in the Air Force does the base commander throw an open invitation to party for two days at his place around a national holiday? If you\u2019re stationed on Guam, it happened Friday and Saturday after July 4, Independence Day, at the home of Brig. Gen. Thomas Palenske, commander of the 36th Wing and Andersen Air Force Base. \u201cThe Slip and Slide scheduled for the Joint Force at my house on 5 July and 6 July,\u201d Palenske posted on the 36th Wing Commander Facebook page July 2, referring to backyard waterslides popular in summertime. \u201cWe\u2019ll have a couple of food trucks available, a DJ and you are free to bring your own lawn chairs and BYOB! The event will basically be a base wide block party! Should be EPIC!\u201d The all-hands, family-friendly event was \u201cepic,\u201d if photos Palenske subsequently posted are credible. One post attracted more than 2,000 \u201clikes,\u201d and the whole series of posts created an online buzz. \u201cYour posts make me want to reenlist!!\u201d wrote Todd Krueger, an Air Force veteran and commenter from Texas. Palenske has turned his official Facebook page into a morale booster, in which he lauds the achievements of individual airmen, comments on the weather, wildlife and other aspects of life on Guam and often ends with the exclamation, \u201c\u2019Murica!\u201d followed by a U.S. flag emoji. The slip and slide party went above and beyond, with a flurry of photographs on Facebook highlighting record-setting and record-breaking rides on the 400-foot-long slide. \u201cSo, what Gen. Polenske really wanted to do was, he wanted to get people together, just to spend time together as human beings, to really just get the community vibe,\u201d Master Sgt. Ryan Kegler, Agile Combat Support flight chief, told Stars and Stripes by phone Tuesday. \u201cHe\u2019s really big on putting people first and he really cares about the well-being of his folks, and that was very evident in how excited he was for this event.\u201d Kegler said he worked on planning and involving different agencies to bring Palenske\u2019s vision of an epic slip-and-slide event to reality. \u201cWe had a lot of folks kind of coming through in waves,\u201d Kegler said. \u201cBetween the two days, probably about 500 folks.\u201d Airman 1st Class Bailey Poage became a slip-and-slide celebrity thanks to a photograph of him airborne on a bodyboard atop the slide. Polenske humored his followers with Poage cut and pasted into various aircraft photographs: fired like a missile from an F-22 Raptor, sliding from the rear end of a CH-47 Chinook helicopter and launched like cargo from a C-141 Starlifter, an airlifter no longer in service. \u201c(W)e brought it back from the boneyard for this special event!\u201d Polenske replied to one commenter. \u201cHad to pull a couple pilots and a load master out of four VFWs to cobble together a qualified crew\u2026\u201d Jordan Morgan, an Air Force spouse, said Palenske is the third base commander in the three years her family has been on Guam. \u201cThanks Gen! My kids and husband had a blast,\u201d Morgan commented on a Palenske post on Saturday. \u201cHe is honestly one of the best!\u201d she told Stars and Stripes by Facebook Messenger on Tuesday. The grand prize for longest slide, a Yeti cooler, went to Col. Tom Bowman, commander of the 36th Operations Group at Andersen, who gave the prize instead to second-place finisher Airman 1st Class Rogers, no first name given, according to a post on the commander\u2019s Facebook page \u201cWe\u2019re out here in the middle of the ocean and it\u2019s important for us to know that we have each other as a community, as airmen, as a wing,\u201d Kegler said. \u201cGen. Polenske\u2019s top priority is people, and when you take care of the people, when the people have that sense of community, then everything else kind of falls in place.\u201d",

        "text": "Joe Biden\u2019s recent dull debate performance has sent shockwaves through Democratic circles\u2014 strategists, lawmakers, donors, and voters alike. This has intensified ongoing worries about his age and mental capabilities to win against former President Donald Trump. In light of the same, as per HuffPost, two Democrats came up with an ingenious idea\u2014 enlisting celebrities to back a rapid primary process if Biden withdraws from the race before the elections in November. Rosa Brooks and Ted Dintersmith have given a proposal, a copy of which CNBC obtained. Semafor was the first to break the news. The plan suggests that Biden should bow out of the race by mid-July before the August convention. It outlines a 'blitz primary' where potential Democratic candidates would submit their bids, and delegates at the Democratic National Convention would cut the list down to six finalists, as reported by CNBC. Pop star Taylor Swift with her massive fanbase, and Michelle Obama and Oprah Winfrey (to usher Black support), and comedian Stephen Colbert have been suggested as potential moderators for candidate forums to increase voter engagement. This plan requires delegates to cast their votes for the final nominee at the DNC. Dintersmith said in an email, \"We know we are not in any position to define what actually happens, but we are so encouraged by the uniform reaction: 'Wow! If something along these lines happened, America would be lifted from our current doldrums.'\" Additionally, Brooks said, \u201cThe tone has very much been, \u2018Oh, my God, this is probably impossible, but what a great idea.'\u201d She continued, \"It's gone, in a few days from, 'Oh, this would be so great if only it could happen, but it probably can't,' to 'Why can't it?'\" In reaction to the reports by Semafor and CNBC, a Biden campaign spokesperson emphasized the president's recent decisions. They highlighted that July had seen the strongest grassroots fundraising start of any month in the campaign's history. Additionally, they referenced Biden's remarks during his visit to Wisconsin as a testament where he had asserted, \"I'm not letting one 90-minute debate wipe out three and a half years of work. I'm staying in the race, and I will beat Donald Trump.\" Meanwhile, Rep. Melanie Stansbury said, \u201cJoe Biden is our president. He is the Democratic nominee and we\u2019re going to fight like hell to get him reelected.\" According to HuffPost, Stansbury shared that she saw enthusiasm whenever she highlighted Biden and his achievements at political events. \u201cI think people understand what a consequential president he has been and they are more motivated than ever to get back out there, to get on the campaign trail.\" Rep. Hank Johnson also affirmed that Biden still has his backing, along with the support of many others in the group.",

        "text": "Joe Biden has 99 problems this week\u2014and men are a big one. Any Democrat who replaces him will almost surely face similar difficulties from a group of people who think of themselves as courageous tough guys, but are among the American electorate\u2019s most fearful voters. If Democrats want to win in November, whether Biden is replaced or not, they need to figure out how to assuage men\u2019s fears\u2014without alienating the women who are key to delivering Democrats a victory. According to recent polling, no demographic group has confidence that the president remains young enough to do the job, even among groups that largely still plan to support him. After his debate debacle, he hemorrhaged support, with a New York Times/Siena poll finding that Trump now leads Biden by 6 points, the widest margin those pollsters have seen since 2015. Trump\u2019s advantage among male voters, and especially among men without college degrees, is well-documented. But Biden overcame it in 2020, and this year, Democrats have a sharper edge with female voters, many of whom are incensed about Republican-appointed Supreme Court justices overturning Roe v. Wade and opening the door for Republican-led state legislatures to criminalize abortion, and potentially come for contraception and fertility treatments next. That Republicans in Congress have refused to protect contraception or IVF, and continue to oppose abortion even if they don\u2019t really want to discuss it in an election year, does not help their cause. Even Trump, who brags about appointing judges who overturned Roe, sees this for the catastrophe it is, and is trying to convince voters that he won\u2019t ban abortion nationwide. One question, though, is whether Democratic advantages with women will outweigh Republican advantages with men, which under Trump have grown. Previously reliable Democratic voters, including Black, Hispanic, and young men, have shifted rightward. And Biden\u2019s increasingly visible frailty doesn\u2019t help the Democratic math. While women actually moved slightly towards Biden after the debate, perhaps recalling the exuberant and unbridled misogyny of Trump and his presidency, men defected en masse: Trump\u2019s already-commanding lead among men nearly doubled, from 12 points to 23. In late June, just before the debate, Biden was leading Trump among men under 30; afterwards, Trump has pulled ahead among this group by 9 points. These statistics are dire, but they shouldn\u2019t be interpreted as cause for Democrats to chase men at any cost. The Republican Party and its Supreme Leader have made unabashed efforts to appeal to male voters at the expense of female ones, embracing a kind of masculinity that hinges on demeaning and diminishing women. It\u2019s not just Trump choosing a UFC fight for his first public appearance after being convicted of 34 felonies, or even weeks later suggesting that the company start a \u201cmigrant league of fighters\u201d so that people Trump considers sub-human might tear each other to shreds for his entertainment\u2014the kind of bizarre machismo that has come to characterize this president\u2019s views. It\u2019s his unrestrained admiration of dictators for their apparent masculinity, a view he expressed in a video obtained by The Daily Beast in which he praises Chinese President Xi Jinping, calling him \u201ca fierce man, very tough guy,\u201d and questions\u2014while sitting limply in his golf cart\u2014whether Biden will be able to deal with men like Xi and Russian leader Vladimir Putin. It\u2019s his and his party\u2019s efforts to curtail women\u2019s basic rights to our own bodies. It\u2019s the repeated Republican insistence that gender traditionalism, with men holding all the financial and political power and women dependent on them, is the ideal way to structure a society. It\u2019s conservatives repeatedly insulting successful or ambitious women, sometimes with misogynist slurs. Some conservatives have even called to repeal the 19th Amendment and end women\u2019s voting rights. Shocking numbers of American women don\u2019t seem troubled by any of this, perhaps because misogyny is so baked into their lives that this all reads as acceptable, or at least within the realm of normal. And even more shocking numbers of American men are not only untroubled, but entertained, enthused, and inspired. These voters are largely unwinnable for Democrats, and the downsides of trying to cater to gleeful misogynists are simply too high, both electorally and morally. Getting pro-choice women out to the polls in November is more important than convincing he-man woman-hating Trump devotees that the Dems are for them. But every election victory relies on both turnout and persuasion. Men make up nearly half of the U.S. population, not exactly a niche interest group. And the men who jumped from Biden to Trump may be persuaded to come back\u2014if Democrats run the right ticket and send the right message. One reason voters shift rightward is fear, an emotion that animates a whole lot of conservative behavior from opposition to immigration to gun ownership. Conservatives are more motivated by fear than liberals are, and fear tends to make people more conservative. This is, of course, why the right continually presses the BE AFRAID button: Be afraid of immigrants killing young women (even though native-born men are more likely to commit crimes than newcomers); be afraid of rising crime (even if the numbers are made up); be afraid of transgender athletes pushing your daughters off their sports teams; be afraid of liberals coming for your guns; be afraid of feminists undermining men\u2019s birthrights to money and sex and family and power. One appeal of Trump\u2019s machismo is his willingness to be a ringleader for collective cruelty; another, though, is the implicit promise that Trump will be a kind of Big Daddy protector of the perennially terrified men to whom he appeals. Some of these men\u2014the ones who are more afraid than they are misogynist\u2014are the voters Democrats can win. What these voters seem to want is the sense that they are on a steady and well-fortified ship: That the president will protect them from threats both foreign and domestic; that the very real problems they see in front of them\u2014too-expensive groceries, too-expensive housing, decaying infrastructure, a country that appears to be in decline\u2014will be addressed by a leader who understands their needs and prioritizes them. Joe Biden did all of this in 2020. But in 2024, his struggles suggest that he may not be fully in charge, or may not be up to the task for another four years. And frightened voters who crave a strong male lead may be particularly jumpy when confronted by a president whose current capabilities and very future are uncertain\u2014and who reminds them of their own human frailty and inevitable mortality. The next question, then, is who Democrats can run to calm these men down and pull them back in. Hostility to female leadership is well-documented, and the nation saw it play out in real time in 2016. Democrats looking to the obvious Biden replacement, Vice President Kamala Harris, are now making a crucial calculus with little in the way of real data: Are Americans ready for a female president, and in particular a Black female president? It has been eight years since Hillary Clinton lost, but she was a particularly well-known\u2014and, in some quarters, deeply hated\u2014quantity who, it\u2019s worth remembering, did in fact win the popular vote. The same country that elected Donald Trump also elected Barack Obama. Much is possible; nothing is guaranteed; and perhaps it is both vastly unfair to both Harris and the American public to assume that voters are so blinded by racism and sexism that Democrats need to keep putting white guys up for the White House. Harris is young, measured, experienced, intelligent, and reliable. Compared to an erratic and untrustworthy convicted criminal, that should be more than enough. And Democrats can always heed the advice of historian and author John Ganz, who suggested on Twitter that the party run \u201cKamala and a cracker.\u201d What is clear, at least, is that the Joe Biden who appealed to a critical number of men in 2020 is not having the same effect four years later and four years older. The core Democratic coalition is one of Black and other voters of color, as well as women (and particularly college-educated women and women of color), and betraying these constituencies by aping the GOP\u2019s contemptuous misogyny, or even their smug indifference to female voters, is a losing proposition. But so is ignoring mass male defection\u2014and the anxieties driving it.",

A day of mourning is being observed in the country as a result of the attacks.Searches were still ongoing on Tuesday for survivors trapped beneath rubble at Ukraine's largest pediatrics facility.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said late on Monday that in total, nearly 100 facilities were damaged nationwide, including the Okhmatdyt Children's Hospital, civilian houses, kindergartens, a maternity hospital, a college and a business center.\"A Russian missile struck the largest children's hospital in Ukraine, targeting young cancer patients. Many were buried under the rubble,\" said Zelensky.\"The rubble is still being cleared at these sites,\" he said in a statement on his social media channels, calling Monday's attack on the Okhmatdyt Hospital \"brutal\" and describing Russian President Vladimir Putin as a \"bloody criminal.\"\"Russian terrorists must be held accountable for this. Mere concern does not stop terror. Condolences are not a weapon,\" the Ukrainian leader said.He added: \"We need to shoot down Russian missiles. Russian combat aircraft must be destroyed where they are based. Strong steps must be taken to eliminate any security deficit.\"Russia denied targeting the children's hospital, saying on Monday that debris from a Ukrainian air defense missile hit the facility. Ukraine said Russia used a Kh-101 cruise missile to attack the site.

        "text": "KYIV, Ukraine -- Rescue operations stretched into a second day at a major Kyiv children\u2019s hospital struck by a Russian missile, Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Tuesday, adding that 38 people were killed and almost 200 injured in an intense daytime barrage that smashed into cities across the country. Zelenskyy said on the social platform X that 64 people were hospitalized in the capital as well as 28 in Kryvyi Rih and six in Dnipro \u2014 both in central Ukraine. It was Russia\u2019s heaviest bombardment of Kyiv in almost four months and one of the deadliest of the war, hitting seven of the city\u2019s 10 districts. The strike on the Okhmatdyt children\u2019s hospital, which interrupted open-heart surgery and forced young cancer patients to take their treatments outdoors, drew an international outcry. Kyiv city administrators declared Tuesday an official day of mourning. Entertainment events were prohibited and flags lowered in the capital. Russia denied responsibility for the hospital strike, insisting it doesn\u2019t attack civilian targets in Ukraine despite abundant evidence to the contrary, including Associated Press reporting. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov on Tuesday repeated that position, pointing to a Russian Defense Ministry statement that blamed a Ukrainian air defense missile for partially destroying the hospital. The Russian onslaught Monday came on the eve of a NATO summit in Washington where alliance countries are expected to pledge new military and economic support for Ukraine. Russian President Vladimir Putin, meanwhile, was hosting India\u2019s Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Moscow. New Delhi\u2019s importance as a key trading partner has grown since the Kremlin sent troops into Ukraine in February 2022. Zelenskyy was deeply critical of Modi\u2019s visit, saying on X late Monday: \u201cIt is a huge disappointment and a devastating blow to peace efforts to see the leader of the world\u2019s largest democracy hug the world\u2019s most bloody criminal in Moscow on such a day.\u201d ___ Follow AP\u2019s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",

        "text": "Attorneys for a Tesla stockholder who challenged Musk\u2019s 2018 compensation package are asking Chancellor Kathaleen St. Jude McCormick to award them legal fees in the form of stock in the electric vehicle company valued at more than $7 billion at current trading prices. The 2018 compensation package for Musk that was rescinded by the judge was potentially worth more than $55 billion. After a full day of expert-witness testimony and arguments by attorneys, McCormick gave no indication on when she would rule on the fee request. The fee amount sought by plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys dwarfs the current record $688 million in legal fees awarded in 2008 in litigation stemming from the collapse of Enron. Attorneys for the Tesla shareholder argue that their work resulted in the \u201cmassive\u201d benefit of returning shares to Tesla that otherwise would have gone to Musk and diluted the stock held by other Tesla investors. They value that benefit at $51.4 billion, using the difference between the stock price at the time of McCormick\u2019s January ruling and the strike price of some 304 million stock options granted to Musk. Attorney Greg Varallo told McCormick that he and his fellow plaintiff lawyers were simply asking for \u201ca slice of the value pie we created.\u201d \u201cWe did battle with the very best,\u201d Varallo added. \u201cLitigation against Tesla is never easy. There are companies who play by the rules every day, and then there are companies like Tesla.\u201d The plaintiff attorneys argue that their fee request is \u201cconservative\u201d under Delaware law. Instead of a typical 33% fee recovery, they note that they are seeking only 11% of the shares now available to Tesla as the result of Musk\u2019s options being rescinded by McCormick\u2019s ruling. The judge agreed with the shareholder lawyers\u2019 argument that Musk engineered the landmark 2018 pay package in sham negotiations with directors who were not independent. Following the court ruling, Tesla shareholders met in June and ratified Musk\u2019s 2018 pay package for a second time. McCormick made clear, however, that the June vote would not be considered in determining the request for attorney fees. It instead will be the subject of a separate hearing in early August. Meanwhile, some opponents of the fee request argue that the plaintiff attorneys deserve no fee at all because they did not bestow any economic benefit on Tesla and instead may have even harmed the company. Opponents contend that the purported reversal of share dilution among Tesla stockholders is not a benefit to the Austin, Texas-based company itself and cannot be used to justify the fee request. They also note that the fee request fails to quantify or subtract potential negative consequences of the ruling, including the need to find a new way to compensate Musk for six years of non-salaried service to Tesla since 2018. \u201cThe market did not react like this rescission remedy bestowed any benefit,\u201d defense attorney John Reed told McCormick, noting that Tesla\u2019s market capitalization dropped by $15 billion after her ruling. Some critics argue that any fee award should be based only on the number of hours the plaintiff attorneys worked, and a reasonable hourly rate. Adding a multiplier to incentivize attorneys who work on a contingency basis in corporate disputes might also be appropriate, they have suggested. That approach could still result in a fee award of tens of millions of dollars. The current fee request equates to an hourly rate of about $288,000 for plaintiff attorneys and would result in an \u201cunwholesome windfall,\u201d according to opponents. Acknowledging the criticism that the fee request has received, plaintiff attorneys in a recent court filing proposed an alternative fee structure. Under that scenario, they would be willing to accept $1.44 billion in cash, equating to an hourly fee of about $74,000.",

        "text": "KYIV, Ukraine (AP) \u2014 Rescue operations stretched into a second day at a major Kyiv children\u2019s hospital struck by a Russian missile, Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Tuesday, adding that 38 people were killed and almost 200 injured in an intense daytime barrage that smashed into cities across the country. Zelenskyy said on the social platform X that 64 people were hospitalized in the capital as well as 28 in Kryvyi Rih and six in Dnipro \u2014 both in central Ukraine. It was Russia\u2019s heaviest bombardment of Kyiv in almost four months and one of the deadliest of the war, hitting seven of the city\u2019s 10 districts. The strike on the Okhmatdyt children\u2019s hospital, which interrupted open-heart surgery and forced young cancer patients to take their treatments outdoors, drew an international outcry. Kyiv city administrators declared Tuesday an official day of mourning. Entertainment events were prohibited and flags lowered in the capital. Russia denied responsibility for the hospital strike, insisting it doesn\u2019t attack civilian targets in Ukraine despite abundant evidence to the contrary, including Associated Press reporting. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov on Tuesday repeated that position, pointing to a Russian Defense Ministry statement that blamed a Ukrainian air defense missile for partially destroying the hospital. The Russian onslaught Monday came on the eve of a NATO summit in Washington where alliance countries are expected to pledge new military and economic support for Ukraine. Russian President Vladimir Putin, meanwhile, was hosting India\u2019s Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Moscow. New Delhi\u2019s importance as a key trading partner has grown since the Kremlin sent troops into Ukraine in February 2022. Zelenskyy was deeply critical of Modi\u2019s visit, saying on X late Monday: \u201cIt is a huge disappointment and a devastating blow to peace efforts to see the leader of the world\u2019s largest democracy hug the world\u2019s most bloody criminal in Moscow on such a day.\u201d ___ Follow AP\u2019s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",

        "text": "Leaders from the NATO alliance, and non-ally Western leaders, are descending on Washington, D.C., for this summer\u2019s summit. The alliance is celebrating its 75-year anniversary, though the occasion will not solely be a celebration given the concerns and threats they\u2019re facing, ranging from Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine to Beijing\u2019s continued aggression, among other topics. Defense spending Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine, which will be a central topic of the summit, has spurred nearly the entire alliance to increase its defense spending. A majority of the alliance had been falling short of the defense spending requirements prior to Russia\u2019s invasion, which represents the largest ground war in Europe since World War II. The NATO alliance requires every member to spend at least 2% of its gross domestic product on defense spending, and at least 20% of it should be spent on equipment, weapons, and other capabilities. Last month, NATO released its preliminary data for 2024, which showed that 23 of the 31 members hit that 2% mark. Ten years ago, only three NATO members hit the goal. Canada and Belgium are the only alliance members expected to fall short of the 20% spending requirement, both of whom also fell short of the 2% GDP requirement. Ukraine Ukraine is not a member of the NATO alliance, and it\u2019s highly unlikely not to be offered membership until the war has come to an end; otherwise, its ascension could immediately trigger Article 5 and bring the alliance directly into the conflict. Despite that, the White House does believe Ukraine should get NATO membership in the long run. \u201cAllies will reaffirm that Ukraine\u2019s future is in NATO; will make significant new announcements about how we\u2019re increasing NATO\u2019s military, political, and financial support for Ukraine. This is part of Ukraine\u2019s \u2018bridge to NATO,'\u201d a senior Biden administration official said. Biden/Trump President Joe Biden is facing significant concerns domestically following last month\u2019s presidential debate in which he appeared forgetful and lost, essentially raising flags about his fitness for another term. Several House Democrats have called on him to end his presidential campaign, though he has repeatedly said he is staying in the race. His performance this week will be watched with bated breath. Biden has rallied the alliance from the start of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine back in February 2022. The alliance has provided Ukraine with billions of dollars of military and humanitarian support over the course of the war. He has also been at pains to say in the aftermath of his disastrous debate with former President Donald Trump that NATO expansion happened on his watch. His 2024 opponent has not been publicly as supportive of Ukraine as Biden, and he has spoken about the possibility of not coming to the defense of allies within the alliance who are not meeting the 2% spending requirement. European upheaval The summit will be new British Prime Minister Keir Starmer\u2019s first appearance on the world stage, only days after his resounding victory in the elections. He will meet with Biden on Wednesday. Additionally, French President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s government is facing political uncertainty after left-wing parties united to beat a surging far-right party. Viktor Orban, the leader of Hungary, is one of Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2018s closest allies within NATO and recently traveled to Ukraine, Russia, and China following his recent takeover of the rotating presidency of the Council of the European Union.",

In a post shared on Instagram on Monday, July 8, the singer and actress, 32, posed poolside in a red string two-piece just four months after welcoming her daughter with her fianc\u00e9 Robert Pattinson. In the snap, the Daisy Jones & the Six star looked incredible as she sat by the edge of a swimming pool at what appeared to be a hotel resort. The photo was followed by a shot of Waterhouse and two friends sitting on sun loungers around a tray filled with bowls of berries including blueberries, raspberries and strawberries. \u201cNot enough time in the world for the amount of berries and books I wish to consume ?,\u201d Waterhouse jokingly captioned the post. \u201c?,\u201d wrote Paris Hilton in the comment section. \u201cPraying i look this good after giving birth,\u201d added a fan, while a second wrote, \u201cSummer looks good on you \u2764\ufe0f\u200d?.\u201d Elsewhere in the carousel post, Waterhouse shared snaps of her summer reading \u2014 Liz Phair\u2019s Horror Stories: A Memoir and Jackie Wang\u2019s Alien Daughters Walk Into the Sun \u2014 along with a selfie and another poolside shot with her model pal Sadie Newman. On her Instagram Stories, she also shared another bikini snap taken from a different angle as she looked off into the distance. The PEOPLE Puzzler crossword is here! How quickly can you solve it?

Speaking with British Vogue for their August cover story earlier this month, Waterhouse shared how she cried as soon as she was out she was having a little girl. \"I wish I hadn't wanted to find out, but I needed to prepare myself mentally,\" she told the publication, adding that the \"instant\" she learned she was having a girl, she called her mom \"in a flood of tears.\" Never miss a story \u2014 sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer\u200b\u200b, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.

        "text": "Gov. Andy Beshear is among the ten politicians whom the venerable news magazine, The Economist, has suggested as \u201cplausible alternatives\u201d to President Joe Biden. Vice President Kamila Harris is among the other nine. But the general problem with most Democratic leaders is their tunnel vision. They seem beholden to the deadly status-quo. Most of them are not questioning Biden\u2019s candidacy. His senility has made him so stubborn that he cannot even see the writing on the wall, let alone read it. Some of them, while saying, \u201cwe have his back,\u201d are unknowingly stabbing America in the back. Contrarily, they should encourage Biden to get off America\u2019s back. The decrepitude of Biden candidacy is a certain route to Trump 2.0 and a GOP-controlled Congress. If that materializes, it will be an open season on freedom and democracy. Beshear should speak up about Biden To his credit, Beshear did question the state of Biden\u2019s health, like Nancy Pelosi did. And like, so far, five Democratic members of the House have done, publicly. Another four did it privately. Beshear should build on his stance, but soon. He should empathetically but firmly emphasize that the president is not fit for the job. Being the first governor to do so will add to his national profile. Even if someone else beats him to it, he would still receive attention. Any Democratic leader with presidential ambitions will do themselves a great favor by speaking up about the dire straits in which Biden\u2019s nonsensical behavior has placed the country. Time is running out. The sooner they do it, the better. I will be happy if any Democrat does it. But I will be happier, if the governor of my state does it. Beshear for President? Andy Beshear's inclusive approach would be a refreshing alternative for president Whoever does it should keep a few points in their arsenal of arguments. I am stating them in a direct way, as I am just writing an article. But they can fine-tune them. Here are those points: Let\u2019s give Biden some credit: He still remembers there is no king in America. So he should stop acting as one. What business do his family members have in boarding the Marine One, landing in Camp David, enjoying its comforts, and wanting to keep the privileges for four more years, the country be dammed? They are not a king\u2019s family.Biden and his staff have been saying he is mentally fit. The lie held until the debate with Trump blew the cover.Post-debate, Biden and his staff doubled down on lying. When, in the debate, Biden said, \u201cwe finally beat Medicare,\u201d besides showing aloofness and incoherence at many other points, America and the world saw what they saw. But his cronies are blaming the media for it. That was a live event, not a news report. So how can one blame the media for Biden\u2019s mental collapse?Trump often refers to Biden as \u201csleepy Joe.\u201d One can imagine the political ads Trump\u2019s campaign will generate with a clip of Biden saying he fell to sleep in the debate. Biden did say that in a post-debate rally.Biden told Geroge Stephanopoulos in the July 5 interview that he encounters a cognitive test every day, so he will not take one to allay anxieties about his diminished faculties. He did not mention that he miserably failed the cognitive test that the debate gave him.The interview did nothing to improve Biden\u2019s image. He was as higgledy-piggledy as he was in the debate. We have now also learned his team has been giving potential interviewers questions to ask him. If he cannot handle journalists\u2019 impromptu questions, will he ask Vladimir Putin and Iran\u2019s ayatollahs for their playbooks in advance, if he were to negotiate with them?Suddenly, Biden and his visionless Democratic sycophants are as big a threat to America\u2019s democracy as are former president Donald Trump and his minions in the Republican Party. Trump thinks he owns America. Now, so does Biden. They both to want to gamble America\u2019s wellbeing for the second term. It seems it\u2019s all about them, not America. When Stephanopoulos raised a question on that, Biden flashed a sarcastic and self-conceited smile, as if asking who me, the savior? Patriots do not have a savior complex.Biden said June 27 was just a bad day, and he had a cold and a jet-lag. How many bad days a week or month does he experience? If the luxuries of Air Force One could not somewhat cushion him from a jet lag that stayed for a week or so, he is clearly unwell. A cold does not encumber one\u2019s cognitive abilities, unless it is Covid, which Bide said he did not have.If it was just a bad night, the people would have realized it themselves. Biden and his cohort would not have had to lie profusely, to counter the fallout. Frankly, more than the debate debacle, it\u2019s their post-debate behavior that leaves nothing to imagination. Gerth: If Democrats move on from Biden after poor debate, Andy Beshear won't be the guy America is at a crossroads. I hope a Democratic leader will pull America from the edge of the abyss at which it finds itself, rescuing it from the idiocies of two old men. Andy, please try to be that rescuer. You are a great governor. Now America needs you. Siddique Malik is an observer of sociopolitical affairs. He has made occasional op-ed contributions to the Courier Journal, for the past two decades.

When Trump was in office, fewer than 10 member states were spending 2% of their GDP or more on defense and that figure has risen to 23 out of the alliance's 32 current members, Gottemoeller said. Gottemoeller, who currently lectures at Stanford University, expressed skepticism that Trump would actually withdraw from NATO, despite his threats on the campaign trail. Still, it will be \"very, very important for the NATO allies to be paying close attention to Trump and what he wants to accomplish\" should he win, the former diplomat said. If Trump returns to the White House, a \"core demand\" will be for NATO allies to spend more than 2%, she said. \"We already heard that during his first time in office, and I think we will hear it again.\" Gottemoeller served as NATO's deputy secretary-general from 2016 to 2019 and on the National Security Council as director for Russia, Ukraine and Eurasia affairs in the early 1990s.

Beyond anecdotal complaints such as frequent Honda break-ins, some data substantiates these reports. According to the 2023 dependability study by J.D. Power, Honda is ranked below the industry average of 186 problems per vehicle, with an average of 205 problems per vehicle. While Honda vehicles remain a top pick for many, others disagree. In this article, we look at five reasons, shared by users on TikTok, why some car buyers on social media are starting to look elsewhere. \u2018Bad\u2019 dealership maintenance Jessica Randall (@jessicarandall3) had an unpleasant experience at a Honda dealership, and she shared the ordeal on TikTok. In her video, Randall explains that when she went to pick up her car, she couldn\u2019t find it in the parking lot despite the dealership giving her the keys. Using the panic button, she discovered her car was still in the now-locked garage bay. After finally making it inside her car, she showed the service receipt, which included a $18.95 charge for a tire rotation and pressure check. Yet, her car\u2019s display showed the front right tire underinflated at 27 psi. \u201cWe are day two and still at 27\u2026\u201d she commented. \u201cShoutout to Honda, only the best for their paying customers,\u201d Randall wrote sarcastically in the caption. The dealership owner later contacted her and offered a refund. The new Accord isn\u2019t popular among buyers TikToker and car enthusiast Sean Chandler (@sean.chandler) says Honda\u2019s new Accord is struggling, calling it the worst year ever for the model. In his video, Chandler explains why the once-popular sedan is \u201cflopping.\u201d Chandler starts by comparing the Accord to the Hybrid Toyota Camry, noting that for just $500 more, the Camry provides better value due to its superior gas savings. He also mentions the hefty $5,000 extra cost for a hybrid drivetrain in the Accord, which pushes buyers toward options like the Tesla Model 3. Chandler points out the nearly 50% decrease in Accord sales over the past nine years, with only 197,000 units sold in 2023 compared to 388,000 in 2014. He suggests consumers can use this sales slump to negotiate better deals at dealerships. \u201cThe new Accord is a major flop and Honda\u2019s probably scrambling because they\u2019re on track for having one of the worst years of Accord sales in history,\u201d Chandler concludes. Some features make women feel unsafe TikTok user Chicago River (@luxsteck) recently shared her frustration with a feature in her Honda that automatically unlocks the doors when the car is put in park. In her video, she criticizes this feature as something \u201cdesigned by a man.\u201d \u201cNo woman has ever wanted her car to automatically unlock as soon as she [puts] it in park,\u201d River states in her video. In the comments, the TikToker recounts a scary incident. \u201cSome guy once accidentally opened my driver\u2019s door in a bank [because] he thought it was his car,\u201d she wrote. Other women also resonated with the video in the comment section, with one user writing: \u201cMy husband reprogrammed my key so one press unlocked all doors at once and could not understand why I wanted changed back.\u201d Misguided oil change intervals The official TikTok account for Shadetree Automotive (@shadetree.automotive) shared a video with one of their auto techs explaining why he no longer trusts Honda. \u201cThe No.1 reason why I don\u2019t trust the Honda manufacturer anymore is they\u2019ve moved to 10,000-mile oil change intervals,\u201d the mechanic states in the video. He argues that waiting this long can harm engines, saying, \u201cWe are seeing major problems by running ten thousand mile intervals on oil changes.\u201d The mechanic suggests that Honda may be practicing planned obsolescence. \u201cI firmly believe it is not in your best interest to go ten thousand miles in between oil changes, and Honda didn\u2019t do that and make that recommendation with your engine lasting two, three hundred thousand miles in mind,\u201d he shares. He advises changing oil every 5,000 miles to avoid long-term issues: \u201cSomebody that does their oil changes like I do every five thousand miles\u2026 I\u2019m gonna have far less engine problems.\u201d Partnership with General Motors TikTok user @osmiumxc90 went viral after criticizing Honda for its controversial partnership with General Motors, which led to the creation of the 2024 Honda Prologue. In his video, he mocks the collaboration using a PowerPoint presentation. \u201cMe getting mad at Honda after they made the dumbest decision ever,\u201d he captions his video, showing a slide that reads, \u201cYou have a reputation for incredible reliability\u2026\u201d followed by, \u201cBut you chose to partner with\u2026 General Motors,\u201d with a laughing emoji next to GM\u2019s logo. Honda and GM initially teamed up to develop affordable electric vehicles to compete with Tesla. Though that plan was scrapped, they continued collaborating on hydrogen fuel cells. This partnership led to the Honda Prologue, reportedly based on GM\u2019s Ultium electric vehicle platform.",

        "text": "A far-right blueprint for a second Donald Trump administration has become an increasing source of controversy, leading Trump to at least try to distance himself from it. But what would Project 2025 actually do? Clocking in at a staggering 920 pages, the proposal from the conservative Heritage Foundation and more than 100 like-minded groups outlines step-by-step plans to give the next president massive new powers and politicize federal agencies. It also outlines a long wish list of conservative ideas he would pursue with those powers. Among other things, Project 2025 proposes: \u2022 Passing sweeping tax cuts \u2022 Limiting the U.S. role in NATO \u2022 Developing new nuclear weapons \u2022 Abolishing the Department of Education and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration \u2022 Reversing the FDA\u2019s approval of abortion pills \u2022 Reducing legal immigration \u2022 Ending Head Start Stripping NPR and PBS of federal fundingOutlawing pornography While not new, the proposal has received a lot more attention in recent weeks. HBO host John Oliver dedicated a segment on his show, \u201cLast Week Tonight,\u201d to Project 2025, which has now been viewed 6.9 million times on YouTube alone. Black Entertainment Television Awards host Taraji P. Henson encouraged viewers to look up Project 2025 in late June. Other celebrities, such as actor Mark Hamill and singer Lizzo, have posted about it on social media. Heritage Foundation President Kevin Roberts inadvertently drew more attention when he said in an interview that the U.S. was in the process of a \"second American Revolution, which will remain bloodless if the left allows it to be.\" And now, there are signs that voters are responding. Searches for \"Project 2025\" have spiked on Google, while it has become a hot topic on Reddit, where a subreddit with more than 54,000 members is dedicated to defeating it. This guide answers some of the biggest questions Americans have about the conservative playbook. Has Trump endorsed Project 2025? Trump has recently sought to distance himself from Project 2025, but he has close ties to the people behind it. Russ Vought, who headed the Office of Management and Budget under Trump, wrote the chapter on the executive office. John McEntee, who was director of the White House Presidential Personnel Office under Trump, is a senior adviser to Project 2025. Three former Trump administration staffers \u2014 Paul Dans, Spencer Chretien and Troup Hemenway \u2014 are listed as the heads of the Project 2025 team. The Heritage Foundation has a track record of getting Trump to support its ideas. In 2018, it claimed that Trump had carried out or embraced at least two-thirds of its ideas in his first year in office, exceeding a previous high-water mark set in President Ronald Reagan\u2019s first year. In a 2022 keynote address at Heritage\u2019s annual leadership conference, Trump effusively praised Roberts shortly after the latter became the group's president and said Roberts was \"going to be so incredible\" in his new role. Still, Trump denies any connection. \"I know nothing about Project 2025,\" he wrote on his Truth Social account last week. \"I have no idea who is behind it. I disagree with some of the things they\u2019re saying and some of the things they\u2019re saying are absolutely ridiculous and abysmal. Anything they do, I wish them luck, but I have nothing to do with them.\" Notably, the former president did not say which Project 2025 proposals he opposed. In November, the Trump campaign issued a statement saying that proposals by \"various non-profit groups are certainly appreciated and can be enormously helpful\" but stressing that \"none of these groups or individuals speak for President Trump or his campaign.\" \"Unless a second term priority is articulated by President Trump himself, or is officially communicated by the campaign, it is not authorized in any way,\" it said. What does Project 2025 say about federal workers? The proposal's most dramatic shift would be to reclassify thousands of federal jobs, allowing Trump to fire career employees and replace them with his picks. This would be the most dramatic shift in the federal workforce since the 1880s, when reformers ended the partisan \"spoils system,\" which led to incompetence, graft and corruption within federal agencies. \"Our goal is to assemble an army of aligned, vetted, trained and prepared conservatives to work on Day One to deconstruct the Administrative State,\" the authors say in a foreword. Trump previously tried this move toward the end of his presidency, signing an executive order to create the new job classification \u2014 known as \"Schedule F\" \u2014 in October 2020. President Joe Biden repealed that order when he took office and sought to add new protections for federal workers. Many other Project 2025 plans rely on this broad new proposed power, as they would need federal workers to sign off on implementation. Robert Shea, who served in the Office of Management and Budget under President George W. Bush, has said that Schedule F would create \"an army of suck-ups\" within the federal government since if federal workers objected that a policy was unwise, impractical or even illegal, they could be fired. What does Project 2025 say about climate change? The proposal would roll back many current efforts to fight climate change while also promoting oil and gas. In short, the proposal calls for a \u201cwhole-of-government unwinding\u201d of what it calls \u201cthe Biden Administration\u2019s climate fanaticism.\u201d Project 2025 calls for ending subsidies for wind and solar power, making it easier to drill domestically for oil and natural gas and build nuclear power plants, promoting fossil fuels in the developing world, ending federal mandates and subsidies for electric vehicles and breaking up NOAA, which it says has \u201cbecome one of the main drivers of the climate change alarm industry.\u201d One section says the Environmental Protection Agency has used \u201cfear-based rhetoric\u201d about \u201cthe perceived threat of climate change\u201d by overstating its \u201cactual harms.\u201d Another says the secretary of energy should \u201coppose eyesore windmills built at taxpayer expense.\u201d What does Project 2025 say about immigration? The proposal would add new restrictions on legal immigration and use various executive actions to reshape the immigration system. Project 2025 would target the \"Dreamers,\" people who were brought to the U.S. illegally as children and who received protection from deportation under the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. Under Project 2025, the Department of Homeland Security would deprioritize staff work on DACA and other \"unlawful programs\" to the point that Dreamers would be unable to renew those protections. The proposal would take the same approach with Biden's Uniting for Ukraine program, which allows more Ukrainians to come to the U.S. The proposal also calls for blocking federal student loans to DACA recipients, as well as state colleges that provide in-state tuition rates to Dreamers. Project 2025 also calls for the secretary of homeland security to decline to update or expand H-2A and H-2B visas used by guest workers, restrict temporary visas given to victims of human trafficking, let Temporary Protected Status designations for countries affected by armed conflict or environmental disasters lapse and increase fees on immigration paperwork. An analysis from the Niskanen Center, a centrist think tank, summarizes the proposals as a \"meticulously orchestrated, comprehensive plan to drive immigration levels to unprecedented lows\" while circumventing Congress and the courts. What does Project 2025 say about criminal justice? The proposal calls for a \"top-to-bottom overhaul\" of the Justice Department and the FBI, repeating Trump's baseless claims about the department and the bureau: It proposes changing the supervision of the FBI within the Justice Department to curb its independence, a move that critics say would give the president more power over prosecutions. It also calls for an \"immediate, comprehensive review\" of all active FBI investigations, ending any that are \"unlawful or contrary to the national interest\" and possibly issuing a public report. It would also bar the FBI from attempting to combat \"the spread of so-called misinformation and disinformation.\" What does Project 2025 say about education? The proposal calls for reducing the federal role in education policy, including eliminating the Education Department and refocusing higher education policy on job skills. Overall, Project 2025 proposes eliminating federal education spending programs or turning them into \"no-strings-attached\" block grants that states could spend however they wanted. It also suggests tying federal spending directly to students, which would allow it to be used on private schools. (The proposal is vague about how exactly this would be implemented.) One section calls for ending Head Start, a comprehensive early education program for low-income children under five that has served about 39 million children since it started in 1965. The proposal also calls for rescinding the congressional charter of the National Education Association, the leading labor union for teachers and other educators, and conducting congressional hearings about its political activities. In higher education, it calls for focusing more on \"bolstering the workforce skills of Americans who have no interest in pursuing a four-year academic degree.\" What does Project 2025 say about student loans? The proposal calls for limiting or ending student debt forgiveness programs, turning the current government-run student loan program over to a new federal authority and tightening income-driven student loan repayments. \"The new Administration must end the practice of acting like the federal student loan portfolio is a campaign fund to curry political support and votes,\" it says in a criticism of Biden's student debt forgiveness measures. \"The new Administration must end abuses in the loan forgiveness programs. Borrowers should be expected to repay their loans.\" The proposal criticizes the expansion of income-driven repayment programs, which tie payments on federal student loans to income. It says the Education Department should phase out existing programs and consolidate them in a new plan open only to the lowest-income Americans: What does Project 2025 say about abortion? The proposal calls for the Food and Drug Administration to withdraw its 2000 approval of mifepristone, a widely used abortion pill that has recently become a target of anti-abortion-rights activists. The U.S. Supreme Court recently rejected a legal challenge to the drug, arguing that a group of doctors who brought the case did not have standing to sue. Louisiana recently classified mifepristone and misoprostol, also used in medication abortions, as controlled dangerous substances. The proposal also calls for barring sending abortion pills through the U.S. mail or by private companies like UPS and FedEx by reviving the Comstock Act, an 1873 law, a move that abortion rights supporters say would amount to a \"backdoor scheme\" to ban abortion. It also proposes banning the military from spending any money to \"facilitate abortion for servicemembers,\" creating a \"pro-life task force\" in the Department of Health and Human Services to \"promote the life and health of women and their unborn children\" and appointing a \"special representative for domestic women's health.\" \"HHS should return to being known as the Department of Life by explicitly rejecting the notion that abortion is health care,\" it says. What does Project 2025 say about LGBTQ rights? The proposal calls for the federal government to promote heterosexual marriage and proposes new restrictions on transgender Americans. On education policy, it would bar public educators from calling students by names other than what are listed on their birth certificates or pronouns other than their \"biological sex\" without written permission of their parents or guardians. It would also allow all public educators to opt out of using pronouns if they are \"contrary to the employee's or contractor's religious or moral convictions.\" On health policy, it calls for ending any research based on \u201cwoke transgender activism\u201d at the National Institutes of Health and having the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services recommend that gender-reassignment surgery not be covered in state health plans. On military policy, Project 2025 proposes banning transgender Americans and people with HIV from serving in the military, expelling any current service members with \"gender dysphoria\" and barring the military from spending any money on \"transgender surgeries.\" More broadly, the proposal calls for rescinding regulations that bar discrimination \u201con the basis of sexual orientation, gender identity, transgender status, and sex characteristics\u201d and removing \u201cdivisive symbols such as the rainbow flag\u201d from U.S. embassies as part of an effort to stop promoting \u201cpro-LGBT initiatives\u201d in Africa. The proposal also calls for the federal government to \"maintain a biblically based, social science-reinforced definition of marriage and family,\" which it defines as a \"heterosexual, intact marriage:\" Another section calls for the secretary of health and human services to \"proudly state that men and women are biological realities that are crucial to the advancement of life sciences and medical care and that married men and women are the ideal, natural family structure because all children have a right to be raised by the men and women who conceived them.\" What does Project 2025 say about pornography? The proposal calls for dramatically restricting pornography, arguing that it does not deserve First Amendment protection. The foreword argues that pornography \u2014 which it defines to include the \u201ctransgender ideology\u201d \u2014 is \u201cas addictive as any illicit drug and as psychologically destructive as any crime.\u201d (Experts disagree about whether people can become addicted to porn the same way they get addicted to alcohol or drugs.) What does Project 2025 say about nuclear weapons? The proposal calls for a dramatic buildup of nuclear weapons, accelerating the development and production of new weapons despite current arms treaties. Among other things, Project 2025 proposes increasing funding for new and modernized nuclear warheads, developing a new sea-launched cruise missile, buying more intercontinental ballistic missiles and preparing to test new nuclear weapons. It also outlines transforming the U.S. role in NATO, reducing the number of U.S. troops in Europe and requiring allies to provide \"the great majority of the conventional forces to deter Russia\" while relying on the U.S. to provide a nuclear weapons deterrent. The U.S. should \"expand and modernize the U.S. nuclear force so that it has the size, sophistication, and tailoring to deter Russia and China simultaneously,\" the proposal says. In an analysis of the proposal, the nonprofit Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists said that it \"would accelerate the nuclear arms race the United States is already engaged in and encourage the expansion \u2014 or initiation \u2014 of new nuclear weapons programs in other nations around the globe.\" What does Project 2025 say about NPR and PBS? The proposal calls for ending government funding for NPR, PBS and other public broadcasters and ending their status as noncommercial education stations, which exempts them from licensing fees and allows radio stations to broadcast at certain reserved frequencies that can be heard farther away. It notes, however, that this may not be easy. \"The President may have to use the bully pulpit, as NPR and PBS have teams of lobbyists who have convinced enough Members of Congress to save their bacon every time their taxpayer subsidies have been at risk since the Nixon era,\" it says. What does Project 2025 say about taxes? The proposal calls for dramatically simplifying the tax code in ways that would hurt lower-income earners and benefit people with higher incomes. Currently, the U.S. has seven federal income tax brackets, with rates from 10% for taxable income up to $11,000 to 37% on income higher than $578,125 in the 2023 tax year. As an intermediate step, Project 2025 calls for reducing that to two brackets of 15% and 30%; ending \"most deductions, credits and exclusions\"; and setting a cap on untaxed employee benefits. In the long term, it calls for \"fundamental tax reform\" that could include implementing a national sales tax or requiring a supermajority for Congress to raise taxes. It also calls for reducing the corporate income tax rate from its current 21% rate to 18% and repealing various changes to the tax code in the Inflation Reduction Act. That bill, signed into law by Biden in 2022, included a corporate alternative minimum tax, a tax on stock buybacks and tax breaks for clean energy. An analysis of Project 2025 in Tax Notes found that these plans would depend on whether Democrats control the House or the Senate, allowing them to block legislation. But under unified Republican control, \"Trump would likely obtain passage of a great deal of his tax and spending proposals using a single budget reconciliation bill, which, instead of needing 60 votes to block a filibuster, would need only a simple majority,\" it noted.",

        "text": "Nearly three years ago, Alec Baldwin pointed a loaded gun at the cinematographer of the low-budget western movie \"Rust.\" He thought the Colt .45 was empty; it wasn't, and the gun fired, killing Halyna Hutchins. The Oct. 21, 2021 tragedy in New Mexico has led to multiple civil lawsuits, including two brought by Hutchins' family members (one of which has settled). And this week, Baldwin is scheduled to go on trial in a Santa Fe, N.M. courtroom after being indicted in January on a charge of involuntary manslaughter in Hutchins' accidental death. Jury selection begins Tuesday, kicking off an eight-day trial that experts predict will be the most-publicized criminal prosecution in New Mexico's 112-year history. Baldwin has pleaded not guilty. If convicted, the 66-year-old actor-producer could spend up to 18 months in prison. How did Baldwin's case \u2014 which some experts believe is a stretch by prosecutors \u2014 get this far? Public pressure, high-stakes legal maneuvering and hubris all have played a role. Production of the movie finished in Montana last year, but \"Rust\" doesn't have a release date. In addition, New Mexico officials have denied the movie producers' request for as much as $1.6 million in tax incentives. Baldwin and his attorneys declined to comment. Baldwin's criminal case suffered multiple setbacks. And Baldwin \u2014 long a polarizing figure \u2014 has invited additional scrutiny over some of his actions. In a move questioned by experts, Baldwin agreed to an interview with ABC News anchor George Stephanopoulos weeks after the shooting. \"I didn\u2019t pull the trigger,\" Baldwin said. Instead, he blamed others for the tragedy in a wooden church at Bonanza Creek Ranch, a sprawling stretch of high desert south of Santa Fe. Baldwin told Stephanopoulos during the December 2021 interview that he pointed the gun at Hutchins during a rehearsal because she had directed him to. \"During this interview, everything changed,\" special prosecutor Kari T. Morrissey wrote in an April court filing. \"Mr. Baldwin ... blamed the incident on Ms. Hutchins.\" Baldwin was told the gun was \"cold\" that day, meaning it lacked live ammunition. Baldwin and others have emphasized that actors are not tasked with checking guns. On \"Rust,\" two crew members, the armorer Hannah Gutierrez and assistant director David Halls, were responsible for safety. Baldwin's attorneys have argued Baldwin lacked an awareness that his actions could be dangerous. But prosecutors and weapons experts counter that the first rule of gun use is not pointing it at someone and not pulling the trigger, particularly when someone is standing nearby. \"The law is on the side of the prosecutors in this case,\" said Joshua Kastenberg, a law professor at the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque. \"But there's a belief that the facts lean more towards an acquittal than a conviction.\" For example, the armorer has already been convicted of involuntary manslaughter for Hutchins' death. Gutierrez is serving time in a New Mexico prison, which Kastenberg said could reinforce a view among some of the Baldwin jurors that the person most responsible for the tragedy has already been prosecuted. Prosecutors had planned to point to Baldwin's role as one of the film's producers, maintaining that he had an obligation to ensure \"Rust\" was a safe set. But on Monday a judge ruled she won't allow jurors to consider that. Crew members have testified previously that the production was rushed and chaotic. Prosecutors maintain that the producers recognized Gutierrez, who was working on just her second film as head armorer, was overwhelmed. Morrissey plans to introduce evidence \u2014 outtakes from the filming of \"Rust\" \u2014 that depicts Baldwin ordering crew members to hurry up. Kastenberg said the case boils down to: When does negligence become a crime? \"And that's a pretty high bar,\" he said. The investigation into the \"Rust\" shooting has faced multiple hurdles and delays, exacerbated by sharp tensions between defense attorneys and prosecutors. Baldwin has hired a team of eight high-powered lawyers, led by Quinn Emanuel's Luke Nikas and Alex Spiro, who have accused Morrissey and her predecessors of mistakes and misconduct. Morrissey has denied such allegations and countered in an April court filing that the defense's goal is \"to ensure the case is not heard on its merits [but] to discredit the prosecution, investigation and witnesses in the media so that a conviction becomes unlikely for reasons other than Mr. Baldwin's criminal culpability.\" A judge denied Baldwin's repeated requests to dismiss his indictment, clearing the way for this week's trial. Baldwin's statements to ABC News in 2021 influenced the Santa Fe County sheriff's investigation, which spent nearly a year on the case. Still, investigators were unable to determine how live ammunition wound up on the movie set. It was Morrissey who this year \u2014 after studying thousands of photographs from the October 2021 production \u2014 alleged that Gutierrez brought it with her to New Mexico. Sheriff's investigators wanted to see whether Baldwin's account was plausible. So the lead detective, Cpl. Alexandria Hancock, ordered violent testing of the gun. An FBI analyst repeatedly used a rawhide mallet to apply force to the gun, eventually breaking the hammer and sear. Baldwin's legal team seized on the gun damage, suggesting the weapon was prone to malfunction. Morrissey joined the case in March 2023, after the district attorney and the initial special prosecutor stepped down, following several missteps. The following month, Nikas shared with prosecutors evidence that he suggested showed the gun had been modified before Baldwin's use. Morrissey dropped the involuntary manslaughter charge against Baldwin, saying she needed time to investigate. She hired a gun expert to dig into the controversy and learn more about the FBI's destructive tests. As soon as the charges were dropped, Baldwin traveled to Montana to finish the film. Since then, the weapon provider testified that he had received the Italian-made Pietta Colt .45 \u2014 a fully functional replica of an 1880s revolver \u2014 before supplying it to the film production in 2021. Footage from the film also shows Baldwin successfully firing the gun in the days leading up to the tragedy, the prosecutor has said. Gun expert Lucien Haag also has testified that he rebuilt the gun after the FBI damage, and that it functioned normally. Haag also insisted that Baldwin would have had to pull the trigger for the gun to fire. And prosecutors revealed that a \"Rust\" crew member would testify that he saw Baldwin pull the trigger that day. By last fall, Morrissey began preparing to take the Baldwin case to a grand jury with the intent of refiling criminal charges. However, Morrissey first offered Baldwin a plea deal that would have ended the actor's criminal case. In court documents, Morrissey said she told Baldwin's team in October that she would abandon the prosecution if the actor pleaded guilty to negligent use of a deadly weapon, a misdemeanor, according to the April court filing. That was the same charge that the \"Rust\" assistant director, David Halls, had accepted last year, and Morrissey said in the document she felt obligated to offer a similar deal to Baldwin. But October's offer soon unraveled, Morrissey said Baldwin's team did not respond to her offer. Instead, she learned that it had shared details of the confidential settlement with an NBC News entertainment reporter. She also learned that Baldwin was planning to make a media splash by announcing that he was suing the state of New Mexico. The prosecutor also became concerned that Baldwin was \"actively pressuring\" crew members who witnessed the shooting to give interviews in a documentary about him. Legal experts say Baldwin's celebrity could help \u2014 or hurt \u2014 his case. \"There is a sense that runs through the country, not just here in New Mexico but more broadly, that we have two systems of justice,\" Kastenberg said. \"One for the powerful, famous and wealthy and one for everybody else.\" Another lingering question is whether Baldwin will take the stand toward the end of the trial. \"The decision to testify is Baldwin's alone,\" Kastenberg said. \"That's his right.\"",

        "text": "MOSCOW \u2014 India\u2019s Prime Minister Narendra Modi was in Moscow on Monday for a two-day visit, his first since Russia sent troops into Ukraine, complicating the relationship between the longtime partners and pushing Russia closer to India\u2019s rival, China. Modi met Russian President Vladimir Putin at his residence outside Moscow, to be followed by talks at the Kremlin on Tuesday. Modi last traveled to Russia in 2019, when he attended a forum in the far eastern port of Vladivostok and met with Putin. The leaders also saw each other in September 2022 in Uzbekistan, at a summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization bloc. Modi posted photos of his arrival in Moscow on the social media platform X, in both Russian and English, saying he was \u201clooking forward to further deepening the Special and Privileged Strategic Partnership between our nations.\" \u201cStronger ties between our nations will greatly benefit our people,\u201d he wrote, also sharing a picture of himself and Putin hugging. Later, the two leaders were pictured in videos shared by the Kremlin at Putin's residence, Novo-Ogaryovo, near Moscow. Putin drove Modi around the grounds in a buggy and showed him his stable with horses. According to state news agencies, the two had earlier watched a horse show with performers in national Russian dress. Modi thanked Putin on X for hosting him at Novo-Ogaryovo and said he was looking forward to Tuesday's talks which he hoped will \u201cgo a long way in further cementing the bonds of friendship between India and Russia.\u201d Russia has had strong ties with India since the Cold War, and New Delhi\u2019s importance as a key trading partner has grown since the Kremlin sent troops into Ukraine in February 2022. China and India have become key buyers of Russian oil following sanctions imposed by the United States and its allies that shut most Western markets off to Russian exports. India now gets more than 40% of its oil imports from Russia, according to analysts. Under Modi\u2019s leadership, India has avoided condemning Russia\u2019s military action in Ukraine while emphasizing the need for a peaceful settlement. The partnership between Moscow and New Delhi has become fraught, however, as Russia has moved closer to China. Modi notably stayed away from last week\u2019s summit in Kazakhstan of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, a security grouping founded by Moscow and Beijing. Chietigj Bajpaee, senior South Asia research fellow at the U.K.-based Chatham House, said India is increasingly estranged from forums in which Russia and China play a prominent role. \u201cThis is evident in India\u2019s relatively low-key presidency of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization last year, and now the decision by Modi not to attend this year\u2019s summit,\u201d Bajpaee said. A confrontation in June 2020 along the disputed China-India border dramatically altered their already touchy relationship as rival troops fought with rocks, clubs and fists. At least 20 Indian soldiers and four Chinese soldiers were killed. Tensions have persisted despite talks \u2014 and have seeped into how New Delhi looks at Moscow. \u201cRussia\u2019s relations with China have been a matter of some concern for India in the context of Chinese increased assertiveness in the region,\u201d D. Bala Venkatesh Verma, a former Indian ambassador to Russia, told The Associated Press. But Modi is expected to seek to continue close relations with Russia, which is also a major defense supplier for India. With Moscow\u2019s arms industries mostly serving the Russian military in Ukraine, India has been diversifying its defense procurements, buying more from the U.S., Israel, France and Italy. \u201cDefense cooperation will clearly be a priority area,\u201d Bajpaee said, adding that 60% of India\u2019s military equipment and systems is \u201cstill of Russian origin.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve seen some delay in the deliveries of spare parts ... following the Russian invasion of Ukraine,\u201d he said. \u201cI believe both countries are due to conclude a military logistics agreement, which would pave the way for more defense exchanges.\u201d Following an arrest warrant issued in 2023 by the International Criminal Court for his actions in Ukraine, Putin\u2019s foreign travel has been sparse in recent years, so Modi\u2019s trip could help the Russian leader boost his clout. \u201cWe kind of see Putin going on a nostalgia trip \u2014 you know, he was in Vietnam, he was in North Korea,\u201d said Theresa Fallon, an analyst at the Center for Russia, Europe, Asia Studies. \u201cIn my view, he\u2019s trying to demonstrate that he\u2019s not a vassal to China, that he has options, that Russia is still a great power.\u201d Alexander Gabuev, head of the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center, said that Putin\u2019s interactions on the world stage show he \u201cis far from isolated\u201d and that Russia is not a country to be discounted. Trade development also will figure strongly in the talks, particularly intentions to develop a maritime corridor between India\u2019s major port of Chennai and Vladivostok, the gateway to Russia\u2019s Far East. India-Russia trade has seen a sharp increase, touching close to $65 billion in the 2023-24 financial year, due to strong energy cooperation, Indian Foreign Secretary Vinay Mohan Kwatra told reporters Friday. Imports from Russia touched $60 billion and exports from India $4 billion in the 2023-24 financial year, Kwatra said. India\u2019s financial year runs from April to March. He said India was trying to correct the trade imbalance with Russia by increasing its exports. India\u2019s top exports to Russia include drugs and pharmaceutical products, telecom instruments, iron and steel, marine products and machinery. Its top imports from Russia include crude oil and petroleum products, coal and coke, pearls, precious and semi-precious stones, fertilizer, vegetable oil, gold and silver. ___ Pathi reported from New Delhi and Heintz from Tallinn, Estonia.

        "text": "(Editor\u2019s note: This column was written before Russia\u2019s missile attacks on Kyiv, including on a children\u2019s hospital, Monday.) SELYDOVE, Ukraine \u2014 In this devastated small eastern town, in the heavily contested region of Pokrovsk, Russia\u2019s deliberate bombing of civilian targets is visible everywhere. I emphasize the word deliberate, because bombing civilians and civilian infrastructure is the centerpiece of Russia\u2019s strategy to destroy Ukraine, even if it can\u2019t occupy the country fully. As I drive around with Maj. Boris (call sign: Johnson) of the 59th Brigade, he points out an apartment building partly crushed by a glide bomb. \u201cWhat great military targets!\u201d Boris laughs, without humor. Two missiles hit the elementary school, one destroyed the kindergarten. The bank, the polytechnic college, a restaurant \u2014 all crushed. The roof of the local hospital was destroyed; a bomb even targeted the cemetery. This is not collateral damage from war; there are no military installations anywhere in the vicinity. \u201cThey can\u2019t take the big cities, so they try to empty and destroy every village and town, as well as civilian infrastructure for the entire country,\u201d Boris said bitterly. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing but civilian destruction.\u201d Indeed, Vladimir Putin\u2019s war on Ukrainian civilians makes clear what some NATO leaders are still too timid to face up to, as they prepare to meet for the alliance\u2019s 75th-anniversary summit this week in Washington, D.C. Putin wants to destroy independent Ukraine and won\u2019t stop unless he is forced to by Ukraine getting the Western weapons it needs right now and getting on a clear path to NATO membership. Ukrainians keep fighting, not because President Joe Biden and NATO force them to, as Russian propaganda blares daily, echoed word for word by Donald Trump and his MAGA devotees. Ukrainians keep fighting because they know what will happen to them if they agree to a cease-fire. It will only give Putin a breather to prepare for his next attack. Most Americans have no clue about the extent of civilian destruction, rape, murder, torture, and de-Ukrainization Putin has brought to the territories Russia has occupied, nor the number of Russian-speaking Ukrainians he has murdered. My current trip to Ukraine has been aimed at examining how Putin wages war, how Russia acts within the Ukrainian territory it has seized, and how it has treated POWs \u2014 all contributing to Putin\u2019s long list of war crimes. What I have seen is a mountain of evidence as to why there is no point to negotiations with a Kremlin leader who disdains international law, commits war crimes too numerous to catalog \u2014 and has broken every accord Russia made with Ukraine since the Soviet Union dissolved. As nearly every Ukrainian I spoke to repeated: Putin understands only force. The Russian way On this trip \u2014 my fourth since the initial whispers of war in early 2022 \u2014 I visited Kyiv, the key southern port of Odesa, the eastern front lines near Pokrovsk and Chasiv Yar, and the cities of Dnipro and Zaporizhzhia, where many internal refugees from the occupied territories live. One cannot fly into Ukraine because all airports have been closed since the war started. So my route took me by plane through Warsaw, Poland, to Chi inau (Kishinev), the capital of Moldova, and then three and a half hours by car to Odesa. No sooner did I reach the \u201cpearl of the Black Sea\u201d than I saw the results of Putin\u2019s bombing campaign aimed at destroying Ukraine\u2019s power and heating infrastructure. Odesa was dark, as rolling blackouts hit all of Ukraine\u2019s cities. No air-conditioning, except at hotels, restaurants, and for those who can afford generators. That means no refrigeration, and often no water. It means mothers with kids who live in apartments have to carry them, along with nonperishable groceries, up punishing flights of stairs. Many Ukrainians told me Putin\u2019s goal is to freeze the people during the winter, driving millions more to flee to neighboring European countries, and denuding the country of population. This is a war crime. This is why The Hague, Netherlands-based International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants in June for former Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu and top Russian Gen. Valery Gerasimov for attacking civilians and civilian infrastructure in Ukraine. Unfortunately, that won\u2019t stop the Kremlin. \u201cFrom the first days of the invasion, the Russian army proved that human life does not matter to them,\u201d I was told in Kyiv by Ukrainian Prosecutor General Andriy Kostin, who is compiling data on Russian war crimes. \u201cMore than 162,000 civilian infrastructure objects have been damaged or destroyed, and of these, 130,000 are housing.\u201d I have seen this Russian destruction over and over in every big city I have visited \u2014 deliberate targeting of universities, high schools, markets, cinemas, shopping malls, even the Ukrainian equivalent of a huge Home Depot in Kharkiv. \u201cPlunging Ukraine into darkness and cold is an obvious plan of the aggressor and one more sign of the genocidal nature of this war,\u201d Kostin said. I traveled east by car, over bumpy roads and through partly destroyed villages where some people still refuse to leave. We passed endless fields of wheat and rye, and the early yellow buds of the sunflower crop. In stark contrast to those cheerful blossoms, Putin\u2019s disdain for humanity \u2014 including his own troops \u2014 was the subject of much discussion with the military units I visited. I also had many long talks about the death toll caused by Congress\u2019 six-month cutoff of military aid, and the creative efforts of Ukrainian soldiers to hold the line by technological innovation, including drones. Most revolting to Ukrainian soldiers is the Russian disregard for their own men, leaving dead bodies to rot in trenches and fields and even burying the wounded alive. I won\u2019t easily forget the conversation I had with 28-year-old Capt. Hans (his military code name), who heads an artillery battery in the 59th Brigade, and went through the painful \u201cshell hunger\u201d caused by the U.S. aid holdup. Sitting on rough homemade chairs deep in the woods near a base outside Pokrovsk, Hans spoke of the human waves of troops Russia sends forward. When the first wave, usually draftees from the occupied Donbas region, are slain, the second wave advances over their corpses. The next waves are Russian convicts or members of its ethnic minorities. By the 10th or 15th attempt, they often manage to move forward. \u201cThere are plenty of cases where they roll over or through Russian bodies,\u201d Hans told me. \u201cThey throw bodies out of trenches to use the same trenches and don\u2019t mind the smell. \u201cThis is how they advance. When we see the way they treat their own with no respect, as if they are not human, all the hairs on our bodies stand on end.\u201d Stretching his long legs, Hans reflected on a question that deeply bothers many on the front lines. \u201cPutin said Ukraine needed to concede four regions\u201d \u2014 which Russian troops only partly occupy \u2014 \u201cto Moscow. But how can we accept that if there are Ukrainian citizens there who don\u2019t want to live under Russia? They know what will happen, like Bucha, Hostomel, or Mariupol \u2014 massive killing and rapes,\u201d he said. \u201cFor Russian troops in occupied territories, there are no laws. They can do anything they want.\u201d News from Mariupol Capt. Hans\u2019 thoughts on occupied territories touched on a place I often think about: Mariupol. I visited the once-beautiful port city just before Putin\u2019s army blasted it into the ground in 2022. That included bombing the city\u2019s iconic drama theater, which was sheltering 600 women and children. I checked out the office of Me Mariupol in Dnipro, one of a series of centers for Mariupol refugees set up across the country by the city\u2019s former and still de facto mayor, Vadym Boychenko. The mayor\u2019s deputy for these centers, former Mariupol City Councillor Oleksandr Khaliavinskyi, was still visibly affected by the destruction of a multicultural city so many Ukrainians loved. Although there was no electricity on a steamy hot day, at least a dozen volunteers \u2014 all escapees from the city \u2014 were busy helping fellow refugees go through a free clothes rack, fill out legal documents, or pick up their children from a day-care center on the site. \u201cEighty percent of the city buildings were destroyed, including 2,500 apartment blocs,\u201d Khaliavinskyi told me. \u201cMany of these were demolished with dead or wounded inside.\u201d I spoke at a nearby cafe with a 20-year-old university student who escaped from Mariupol in March 2023 \u2014 I will call him Alex because some family members remain in the city. \u201cThe most horrible thing I saw,\u201d he told me, \u201cwas when the Russians blew up a whole building damaged by their rockets with injured people still in it. They took the rubble to the dump, then covered the building site with cement. No one thought to evacuate the living. \u201cPeople were screaming because you could see men and women stuck under collapsed concrete plates. The Russians didn\u2019t bother to help. They waited for them to stop screaming. A nice lady wearing a pink robe was crying for help. Some humanitarian volunteers begged the Russian police to rescue her. They said, \u2018Shut your mouth.'\u201d Putin has made a big show of visiting new prefab apartment blocks with yellow and green trim that are promoted on Russian social media as proving Russia is rebuilding the city. \u201cThe fancy buildings are for those Russians whom their government is bringing from the far east to repopulate the city and do menial jobs. Now the population is more of ethnic outsiders than of locals,\u201d Khaliavinskyi said. \u201cAll the population is forced to get Russian passports, otherwise there is no health care or pensions. In every neighborhood, there are checkpoints to stop and investigate your phone for any Ukrainian channels, which means arrest and torture. People are so scared to use the Ukrainian language and can only receive Russian TV or propaganda,\u201d he added. Youngsters are indoctrinated at school to believe there is no such country as Ukraine, and in adulthood are mobilized into the local proxy army for Russia, which is sent to the front as cannon fodder against brother Ukrainians. Alex told me how Russians had stripped the facilities of his technical university bare, tossing out all books in Ukrainian and even Russian books whose content they disliked. The Russians also looted the local history museum. An avid techie, Alex managed to hack into the database of his university and found a series of presentations the Russians had designed for lecturers to give to high school and university classes. \u201cThe maps showed no more Ukrainian state, and the bulk of the country had been turned into regions of Russia.\u201d \u201cThey teach them the worst lies about Ukraine,\u201d I was told angrily by Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk in Kyiv. She has the hopeful title of minister of reintegration of temporarily occupied territories. \u201cMariupol is practically a city that can be called a cemetery, with buildings constructed over Ukrainian bones,\u201d she said. Indeed, Russia\u2019s treatment of Mariupol and other occupied areas seems identical to current definitions of genocide \u2014 attempting to erase the culture, religion, language, indeed the very identity of a people \u2014 all while deporting tens of thousands of Ukrainian children to Russia for adoption, and jailing tens of thousands of civilians accused of embracing Ukraine or its language. It is little wonder Ukrainians feel their struggle is existential, with Putin openly declaring there is no such thing as a Ukrainian state. In March, the U.N. Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine issued a report condemning the Russian intimidation, violence, detention, and punishment of Ukrainians under occupation. Putin does not care. War crimes One of the ultimate horrors of Russian war crimes is the unspeakable treatment of Ukrainian prisoners of war, especially the last holdouts in besieged Mariupol, who lasted for weeks inside the Azovstal steelworks. They were guaranteed an honorable surrender and humane prison conditions by the International Committee of the Red Cross, which then did little to prevent them from being delivered to pure hell. Prosecutor General Kostin spoke to me at length about the treatment of detainees and POWs and how it violates international laws of warfare. More than 160 torture chambers and places of detention were discovered in liberated territory. Mostly the goal was to eliminate community leaders or anyone who could resist Russian rule. But the methods of torture used bear close resemblance to the Nazi torture chambers in World War II. Nothing is too ugly or disgusting. And as the U.N. report detailed, sexual violence is openly committed by Russian soldiers and interrogators against women and men as a weapon of war. I spoke in Kyiv with Anna Sosonska, a deputy in the chief prosecutor\u2019s office who supervises investigations of sexual crimes committed during the war, and who has been developing a process that protects women and girls from stigma if they come forward with complaints. \u201cThe Russian military uses sexual violence as the cheapest method of terror,\u201d she told me. \u201cWe have incidents everywhere that Russian forces are based.\u201d Sosonska said they have recorded incidents where Russia\u2019s FSB intelligence agents told their victims, \u201cYou are tortured because you are Ukrainian.\u201d As the U.N. report mentioned, more than half of the POWs from the Azovstal steelworks suffered from sexual violence, indicating it was standard operating procedure, not rogue behavior. This is not surprising given the vituperation toward Ukrainians that dominates Russian social media and TV talk shows. What moved me the most about talking with Sosonska was what she told me about the stories her Jewish great-grandmother told her about \u201cthe Nazi camps for Jews.\u201d \u201cThese stories were very similar to the conditions of Ukrainian POWs in Russian camps,\u201d she said. There is good reason why Ukrainians call Putin \u201cPutler,\u201d and why he tries to reverse this label by ludicrously calling Ukrainians \u201cNazis\u201d \u2014 a lie ignorantly embraced in the U.S. by many in the MAGA camp. Putin\u2019s genocidal approach to Ukraine, and his cold-blooded inhumanity, make clear why Ukrainians believe he can only be stopped by force, and by Ukrainian membership in NATO. What I saw and heard in Ukraine illustrates why Trump\u2019s embrace of Putin is reprehensible, and why Biden\u2019s approach must be tougher. As Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy told me in Kyiv: \u201cIt is impossible to help Ukraine with one hand and shake Putin\u2019s hand with the other.\u201d Especially when that criminal\u2019s hand is covered in blood.

        "text": "Two decades ago, the Oracle of Omaha made one very costly decision. By Chase Peterson-Withorn, Forbes Staff Warren Buffett shocked the world in 2006, when he pledged to give away nearly all of his vast fortune. Since then, Buffett has donated more than $55 billion worth of his Berkshire Hathaway to charity, including a $5.3 billion gift in late June that knocked him down two spots on Forbes\u2019 list of the world\u2019s richest people, from 8th to 10th, his lowest ranking in more than two decades. Forbes estimates his net worth to be $128.9 billion. But what if Buffett, perhaps the greatest philanthropist in history, had instead decided to keep all his Berkshire shares for himself? Buffett owned 474,998 class A shares, then worth around $43 billion, when he made that historic announcement in the summer of 2006. If he still owned all that stock today, he\u2019d be sitting on a pile of stock worth $292 billion. Add in another $1 billion or so worth of class B shares and personal investments, and a less charitable Buffett would have a fortune of around $293 billion. That would make him some $41 billion richer than the planet\u2019s current No. 1, Elon Musk (net worth: $252.4 billion); $77 billion ahead of No. 2 Jeff Bezos ($215.9 billion); and $102 billion above No. 3 Bernard Arnault ($191 billion). Instead of being $6 billion poorer than his friend Bill Gates ($135.2 billion), Buffett would be worth more than two Bill Gateses combined. In other words, if Warren Buffett didn\u2019t decide to start giving away his wealth, he would easily be the richest person on Earth. In fact, by Forbes\u2019 estimates, he would be just a hair shy of breaking the record for having the largest fortune ever recorded, set in 2021 when Musk briefly surpassed $300 billion. With his theoretical $293 billion fortune, Buffett could personally buy the entire McDonald\u2019s Corporation, all of Coca-Cola\u2019s stock or all 50 of the world\u2019s 50 most valuable sports teams. Instead, the famously frugal Buffett has been working to give away more than 99% of his fortune, mainly through a summer tradition of donations worth billions of dollars to five handpicked foundations from his stash of stock, with each year\u2019s gift being 5% fewer shares than the previous year\u2019s. \u201cMy family and I will give up nothing we need or want by fulfilling this 99% pledge,\u201d he once wrote. \u201cI will continue to live in a manner that gives me everything that I could possibly want in life.\u201d The majority of Buffett\u2019s gifts have gone to a trust that funds the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, which has gotten stock worth more than $43 billion at the time it was gifted. The $75 billion (endowment) charity launched by Buffett\u2019s friend and bridge partner Bill Gates and his then-wife Melinda French Gates in 2000 has put the money to use on poverty and healthcare initiatives in developing countries and education and economic mobility in America. In 2010, Buffett cofounded The Giving Pledge alongside the Gateses to encourage other billionaires to donate at least half their fortunes to charitable causes as well. Buffett stepped down as a trustee of the Gates Foundation in 2021. French Gates divorced Gates that same year and left the foundation earlier this month to branch out on her own. Buffett\u2019s three children and a foundation named for his late wife have gotten the rest of the shares as gifts designated specifically to go to the charities of their choice. More than $4.8 billion worth of shares (at the time of his gifts) went to the foundation named for his late wife, the Susan Thompson Buffett Foundation, which focuses on healthcare and education. (That sum does not include at least $2.9 billion given to the foundation by Susan\u2019s estate following her death in 2004.) And Buffett has given more than $8 billion in total (at the time of his gifts) to his childrens\u2019 three charities: the Sherwood Foundation, the Howard G. Buffett Foundation and the NoVo Foundation. After nearly two decades of giving, the 93-year-old investor has whittled his Berkshire stake down to 207,963 class A shares, still worth around $128 billion as of July 8. He plans to keep gifting stock to the five foundations each year until his death. But, in a November letter and an interview with The Wall Street Journal published in late June, he said he has decided that what\u2019s left of the Buffett fortune at his death will pass almost entirely to a charitable trust overseen by his children, rather than mainly to the Gates Foundation, as previously believed. When all\u2019s said and done, Buffett and the executors of his estate will have moved more than 99% of his wealth to charity. \u201cSociety has a use for my money,\u201d Buffett\u2014who has lived in the same relatively modest home in Omaha, Nebraska since 1958 and who often stops at McDonald\u2019s for meals, paying in exact change\u2014wrote in 2021. \u201cI don\u2019t.\u201d MORE FROM FORBES ForbesElon Musk's Laughable Solution To Tesla's Child Labor WorriesBy Alan OhnsmanForbesWhy Applications To Historically Black Colleges Are SurgingBy Asia AlexanderForbesWhy Top Nuclear Experts And Ex-CIA Brass Joined A High School Grad's Tiny Fusion StartupBy David JeansForbesThe Top 10 Richest People In The World (July 2024)By Forbes Wealth TeamForbesMarket Lessons: Price To Book, With 14 Cheap StocksBy Hyunsoo RimForbesHackers Are Now Coming For Your Airline Miles And Hotel PointsBy Jeremy Bogaisky Follow me on Twitter.

        "text": "Timothy Mellon is the top donor to both Donald Trump and RFK Jr., two competing presidential candidates, which is just one reason he is unlike any political donor in history. By Phoebe Liu and Zach Everson, Forbes Staff The biggest donor American politics today doesn\u2019t talk to reporters much, deriding the press as \u201cthe propaganda arm of the federal government and the bureaucracy.\u201d So it came as little surprise when Timothy Mellon, a Gilded Age heir who has emerged as a modern power player, largely ignored a series of questions sent to him asking about his family, background and political philosophy. Mellon responded with only a URL, linking to a story about an airplane flying over the Hamptons, where Biden was hosting a post-debate fundraiser, with a one-word trailer behind it: \u201cBI-DONE!\u201d Mellon has 76.5 million reasons to gloat in the wake of Biden\u2019s disastrous debate performance. No one has spent more trying to reinstall Trump in the White House. Linda McMahon, the WWE mogul who served in Trump\u2019s cabinet, has given the second-most of any donor, $11.1 million, or about one-seventh as much as Mellon. Forty-three percent of all money that has gone into Trump\u2019s main super-PAC, Make America Great Again Inc., has come from the 81-year-old heir. Even more remarkable: Mellon is dumping in that much money without the kind of fortune that allows other billionaires\u2014think Bloomberg or Adelson\u2014to give away hundreds of millions without blinking. While those tycoons hold stakes in cash-gushing businesses worth tens of billions of dollars, Forbes thinks Mellon could be worth close to $1 billion, based on his inheritance and proceeds from the sale of his railroad company. He insists his fortune is even smaller: \u201cBillionaire NOT!\u201d he responded in another brusque email. \u201cNever have been, never will be.\u201d In any case, it\u2019s a remarkably modest sum, considering he has given federal political committees a total of $237 million, plus at least another $60 million to state candidates and the border wall. Timothy Mellon and his first wife Susan Tracy Mellon attend a party in 1981\u2014the year Guilford Transportation Industries was founded\u2014to honor the National Gallery established by Mellon's grandfather. Guy DeLort/WWD/Penske Media/Getty Images Despite being the grandson of banking titan Andrew Mellon, Timothy Mellon has earned a surprising amount of his money himself. His father used the family fortune to enjoy a life in aristocracy, devoting enough time to horses that he became a member of the national racing Hall of Fame. Timothy Mellon, by contrast, went to work, borrowing from the Mellon Bank to buy three struggling railroads in the early 1980s and building them over four decades into a $600 million empire. \u201cI have never been without a comfortable financial cushion,\u201d he wrote in a 2015 memoir, \u201calthough I have always felt the need to use my brainpower to augment what I started with.\u201d He kept grinding until a month before his 80th birthday in 2022, when he finally cashed out and turned his attention more fully toward elections. Mellon\u2019s political philosophy has shifted over the years, but he has always strayed from the crowd. Coming from a family of Republican royalty\u2014his grandfather served as treasury secretary for three Republican presidents\u2014Timothy lurched left as a young man, routing money to causes backed by Gloria Steinem and Ralph Nader. When he got into the railroad business, employees demanded support of their unions\u2014he went to war with them instead. More recently, he has not only spent mind-bending sums supporting Donald Trump, but he also has poured $25 million into Robert F. Kennedy\u2019s super-PAC, contributing more than half of its revenue. Mellon may not be answering questions much these days, but in a rare interview with Forbes 36 years ago, he offered a window into his worldview. \u201cIf you believe in something,\u201d he said, \u201cwhat others call you is irrelevant.\u201d H eir to an heir, Timothy Mellon never had to wonder whether his family had money. The fortune began with his great-grandfather, an Irish immigrant named Thomas Mellon, who started a Pittsburgh banking empire shortly after the Civil War. Thomas eventually welcomed his children into the business, including Andrew, Timothy\u2019s grandfather. Andrew invested in companies like Gulf Oil, a predecessor to Chevron, before serving in the cabinets of Warren Harding, Calvin Coolidge and Herbert Hoover. He left a reported $22.7 million in 1930-something dollars\u2013equivalent to roughly $500 million today\u2014for his three grandchildren, including Timothy. Andrew Mellon also left enough for his son, Paul Mellon, to live a life of luxury, in which he obsessed over horses and penned an autobiography titled Reflections in a Silver Spoon. It\u2019s unclear how much Paul Mellon left to Timothy and his sister, though he bequeathed $110 million to his second wife, according to a book by Meryl Gordon, and left more than $200 million to charity. Andrew Mellon (center), Timothy Mellon's grandfather, served as treasury secretary for Calvin Coolidge (left) and Herbert Hoover (right). During his terms, he helped lower taxes on businesses and the wealthy. Keystone/Getty Images Despite the wealth, Timothy Mellon faced challenges in childhood. His mother died when he was four. Mellon said he was told that his sister did not speak to him for the first five years of his life. He attended private school in Massachusetts, then headed to Yale, where his father had studied literature and donated millions. Timothy took to political science, graduating in 1964, then headed to Yale Law School, where he lasted less than a week, intimidated by the professors (\u201csheer terror,\u201d he wrote in his autobiography). His fallback: Another Yale degree, this time in city planning. Mellon drove a fancy blue Gulf truck but did not flaunt his wealth. One classmate, Emily Nugent Carrier, remembers him as \u201cfun and inventive,\u201d adding, \u201cYou never knew he was a Mellon.\u201d Andrew Mellon had two children: son Paul Mellon, TImothy's father, and daughter Ailsa Mellon Bruce. In 1969, they combined their individual private foundations to create the Mellon Foundation in honor of Andrew Mellon. Bettmann/Getty Images A diversion led to his first career. While studying population density, Mellon decided he wanted to make diagrams for his research, so he learned how to code. That skill came in handy after graduation, when he started his first company, a one-man computer business in Guilford, Connecticut, a wealthy suburb outside of New Haven. Mellon\u2019s first job title: president, programmer and dishwasher, he later joked. Around that time, he cast his first vote in a presidential election, straying from his family\u2019s Republican roots to back Lyndon Johnson. These were Great Society years, and in 1969, Mellon joined the fight, cofounding a nonprofit called the Sachem Fund, which described its objective in vague terms: \u201cseek potential solutions for social problems.\u201d Donations went to a foundation supporting economic development for southern Black people, a Gloria Steinem group fighting sexism and a Ralph Nader-backed organization working to increase civic engagement. The fund also backed esoteric causes, like the St. Louis Orienteering Club. During its first seven years in operation, the fund received $4.1 million in contributions (equivalent to $22 million today) and approved $2.7 million in grants ($14 million in today\u2019s terms). Years later, Mellon looked back on his and his first wife\u2019s work with pride\u2014and a tinge of regret. \u201cWe tackled problems of poverty, race and environmental despoliation that were overwhelming the country,\u201d he wrote in his memoir. \u201cSome of the projects, like the first hospice in Branford, Connecticut, were successful; others fell short of our hopes. Still being of the liberal persuasion at that age in our lives, I believe we may have overlooked some fundamental attributes of human nature that would have precluded success in any case.\u201d Timothy Mellon and his business partner David Fink, the two men on the right, participate in a groundbreaking ceremony for a new Massachusetts train station in 2006. They worked together from 1978 to 2022, when they sold their railroad company; FInk died shortly afterward. David L. Ryan/The Boston Globe/Getty Images It's easy to believe in big government when it\u2019s not in your way. Mellon shifted businesses in the 1970s, moving from the upstart computer world to the highly regulated railroad industry. He partnered with a fourth-generation railroader named David Fink, whom he had met at a League of Women Voters event, and started a business manufacturing railroad ties. Before long, the two men decided they wanted to own some track as well, so they created a parent company named after Mellon\u2019s Connecticut town, Guilford Transportation Industries. Guilford\u2019s first purchase offer came with a hint of hubris. For a struggling, 10-mile line in Massachusetts, Mellon and Fink offered to assume ownership if the current owners would hand them $85,000. \u201cThey showed us politely to the door, thank you,\u201d Mellon later recalled. To own a railroad, Mellon realized he would need to spend money. He had plenty\u2014around that time, Forbes estimated his net worth at $100 million. Between 1981 and 1983, his company spent $42.5 million buying two major railroad companies, the Maine Central and Boston & Maine railroads. In January 1984, the company added a third railroad, the near-bankrupt Delaware & Hudson, for $500,000. Approximately half that sum came via a loan from his family\u2019s Mellon Bank, Mellon told Forbes in 1988; he didn\u2019t specify whether the rest was from his inheritance. Through Guilford, Mellon and his partner suddenly controlled a reported 4,000 miles of track stretching from Maine to Buffalo. A train still wearing the old Guilford Transportation paint colors leaves a Maine paper mill in June 2021, even though the company rebranded as Pan Am in 1998. Transporting materials for the paper industry made up a significant portion of the company's revenue. Harrison Smith / North Country Trains Mellon\u2019s strategy: Cut costs everywhere possible. For example, he deemed that trains needed two people, not five, to operate and abandoned swaths of track deemed unprofitable, laying off half Guilford\u2019s workforce, according to a book by Rudy Garbely and past Forbes reporting. That efficiency-minded approach is now commonplace in the industry, termed \u201cprecision scheduled railroading,\u201d but at the time, it was a shock\u2014especially to workers. Guilford employees organized two major strikes around that time, between 1986 and 1988, the first after mass layoffs and failed contract negotiations and the second sparked by a death that union members reportedly blamed on neglected equipment. Desperate for more hands amid the first strike, Mellon jetted around the country searching for people, flying them on his private jet to wherever he had shortages. Employees fumed, but Mellon pressed on. The Boston & Maine railroad broke even almost immediately, with $7 million of net income in 1984. The Delaware & Hudson did not fare as well, declaring bankruptcy in 1988, around the conclusion of the second strike. Mellon\u2019s company then purchased the bankrupt Pan Am airline brand in 1998, rebranding as Pan Am Systems. Mellon and Fink briefly attempted to operate an airline, but it lost money and stopped operating within a decade; in his book, Mellon blamed his chief counsel, who submitted falsified financial documents to the government, the post-9/11 economy and unions. By then, Mellon\u2019s politics had changed. He shuttered the Sachem Fund, his Great Society promoter, at some point after 1980, doling out the last proceeds to conservative groups, like the Heritage Foundation. Mellon\u2019s increasingly right-leaning ideology was no secret to his employees. \u201cMellon\u2019s and Fink\u2019s approach was, in a word, confrontational to nearly everyone,\u201d says a former member of the marketing department, Stephen Demboske. \u201cThey played to their own beliefs, and it was, \u2018I don\u2019t care what you think. I\u2019m going to do what my political conscience tells me to do.\u2019\u201d Two-thousand miles due west of Connecticut, outside of Laramie, Wyoming, Mellon found respite alongside the Laramie River. He had been looking to get out of the northeast, and considered Florida, South Dakota and Wyoming\u2014all states with no income tax. Florida was too busy and South Dakota too boring, so Mellon settled on \u201cextra friendly, peaceful\u201d Wyoming, home to little economic activity but many of the nation\u2019s wealthiest heirs. In 2005, he settled down on a pair of ranches, which he combined with other land to form 6,700 acres of union-free wilderness. Aviator Amelia Earhart shakes the hand of U.S. Ambassador to Britain Andrew Mellon, after completing the first transatlantic flight by a woman, landing in Northern Ireland. New York Times/Getty Images It was from this perch that Mellon made one of his more recent philanthropic contributions, not to a societal program but to a niche interest, donating $1 million to help search for Amelia Earhart\u2019s airplane. Mellon, a licensed pilot with more than 10,000 flying hours, had become interested in Earhart after learning that two of his railroads had partnered with the aviator to launch an airline. \u201cBecause of my companies\u2019 connections with Amelia Earhart,\u201d he wrote in his memoir, \u201cbecause of my interests in aviation and my own world circumnavigations, and because this strange mystery seemed (from what little I knew at the time) so close to solution, I decided that my support would be a useful contribution.\u201d Even that act of charity, however, ended in acrimony. Mellon sued the nonprofit in 2013, alleging that it had accepted his money after it already found Earhart\u2019s plane. A judge tossed the case before it went to trial, writing that it was merely Mellon\u2019s opinion that the group had discovered the plane. Mellon became more committed to politics around this time. He had long been somewhat involved\u2014by early 2018, Mellon had given more than $400,000 to various candidates and causes. It was an impressive sum, but nothing to indicate what was to come next. In May 2018, six months before the midterms, Mellon shelled out $10 million to a super-PAC aimed at electing Republicans to the House of Representatives. In one move, he had established himself as one of the largest political donors in the country. Timothy Mellon\u2019s Federal Political Donations, 2010-2024 Heavyweights show up to title fights. In 2020, Mellon made his first million-dollar donation in a presidential election, donating $10 million to the pro-Trump America First Action super-PAC. After Trump lost and inspired a riot at the U.S. Capitol, several tycoons backed away from the MAGA movement. Not Mellon. He gave $53 million in 2021 to an attempt to crowdfund a border wall, sponsored by Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, the Texas Tribune reported. All other contributions totaled $2.4 million. Mellon soon had more cash at his disposal. In 2022, after nearly a half century in the railroad business, he sold his company to publicly traded CSX in a $600 million deal. It\u2019s unclear exactly how much Mellon received, since his ownership stake remains unclear. But it was certainly significant\u2014a decades-old legal document listed Mellon and Fink as the only shareholders. Given that Mellon had the money, and therefore likely put up most of the capital, it would make sense if he held the large majority of the company\u2014and the windfall that came from its sale. MELLON\u2019S MILLIONS Timothy Mellon says he isn't a billionaire, but Forbes thinks he\u2019s close. First, there\u2019s the inheritance. Grandfather Andrew Mellon left a hefty sum to Timothy and two other grandchildren in the mid-1930s, according to David Cannadine\u2019s book \u201cMellon.\u201d The book value of that gift was $23 million back then, or roughly $500 million today, adjusted for inflation. With wise investing, it could have grown far larger. For example, if the money were plowed into holdings that returned 75% as much as the S&P 500, the $23 million would have turned into $3.6 billion by now\u2014leaving $1.2 billion for each of the grown-up grandchildren, if divided evenly. There\u2019s also the business. Mellon spent an estimated $22 million of his own money buying up railroads in the early 1980s. He sold them in 2022 for $600 million, collecting an estimated $345 million after tax. Now he\u2019s dumping money into politics, spending nearly $300 million over the last decade. It\u2019s hard to imagine someone spending that much without at least a billion to spare, but Mellon, who did not have any children with his first wife, insists that\u2019s exactly what he is doing. \u201cBillionaire NOT,\u201d he wrote in an email. \u201cNever have been, never will be.\u201d That could also help explain why he has felt comfortable scaling up his political donations. Mellon seeded Trump\u2019s main super PAC with a $5 million check last year, and the money continued to flow through the primary season. On the side, Mellon also backed Robert F. Kennedy, distributing $25 million to a super PAC supporting the heir to another American dynasty, old friends of the Mellons from summering in Cape Cod in the 1960s. But his focus remained on Trump, whose super-PAC has now received $76.5 million from Mellon\u2014including $50 million the day after a New York jury convicted the former president on 34 criminal counts. It was a fitting move for Mellon, who has long relished defiance, something his memoir makes clear. \u201cNo apologies will be forthcoming,\u201d he wrote, \u201crelative to the course we took to achieve our success.\u201d MORE FROM FORBES ForbesHere Are Biden's Top 10 Biggest Billionaire DonorsBy Leo KaminForbesHere Are Trump's 10 Biggest Billionaire DonorsBy Leo KaminForbesHere's How Much Joe Biden Is WorthBy Zach EversonForbesElon Musk's Laughable Solution To Tesla's Child Labor WorriesBy Alan OhnsmanForbesWhy Inflation Battered Argentinians Are Turning To CryptoBy Javier Paz",

Instead, the spotlight will fall on the summit's host, President Joe Biden, and growing doubts about his capability to serve as president and represent the United States on the world stage for another four years. But as former President Donald Trump edges ahead in some polls, the looming U.S. election in November has also infused new urgency into some of NATO's key priorities. Among the anticipated events of the three-day summit are a commemoration event Tuesday at the Mellon Auditorium, the site where the NATO treaty was formally signed in 1949; a bilateral meeting with newly elected U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer; a meeting with the EU and NATO's Indo-Pacific partners; and an event with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and nearly two dozen allies and partners who have signed bilateral security agreements with Ukraine. On Thursday evening, Biden will hold a rare solo press conference, which he hasn't done since November. Here are the top storylines to watch: Biden's next big test After Biden's debate performance last month ignited panic among Democrats, his campaign has been urgently searching for opportunities to undo damage and prove the president can be an effective leader for the future. The president himself has set the stakes for the summit remarkably high. He mentioned the alliance six times during his 21-minute interview with ABC News anchor George Stephanopoulos on Friday, saying the event would be \"a good way to judge me.\" But the optics for Biden's campaign may not be ideal. The summit will mark the 75th anniversary of the alliance, and among its 32 members, Biden is the only head of government who was alive during its founding. The president, 81, will share stages with leaders like France's Emmanuel Macron, Denmark's Mette Frederiksen and plenty of other officials who are about half his age. In preparation for the summit, officials say Biden has spent hours huddling with Secretary of State Antony Blinken at the White House -- including on the eve of the summit and over the Fourth of July holiday. Blinken is also expected to be by Biden's side through much of the programming in Washington, according to the officials. Despite reports claiming U.S. allies have privately questioned Biden's ability to lead, the White House rejected the notion they needed reassurance from the president. \"We're not picking up any signs of that from our allies at all. Quite the contrary. The conversations that we're having with them in advance is they're excited about this summit,\" White House national security communications adviser John Kirby said on Monday. Ukraine's road to membership Hours before the start of the summit on Tuesday, a barrage of Russian missiles rained down on Ukraine, hitting multiple civilian targets -- including a children's hospital. The attack -- which left at least 37 people dead, according to Ukrainian officials -- underscored the gravity of the conflict that has indirectly pitted NATO powers against Moscow's aggression. Before Monday's strike on Ukraine, a senior Biden administration official said that the U.S. would announce new air defenses and military capabilities for the country, adding that the summit would send \"a strong signal\" to Russian President Vladimir Putin \"that if he thinks he can outlast the coalition of countries supporting Ukraine, he's dead wrong.\" While Zelenskyy has been pushing for additional air defense systems, he has been critical of NATO's decision to avoid setting a timeline for Ukraine to join its ranks. A major focus of the Washington summit is expected to be what members of the alliance have branded as Ukraine's \"bridge to membership\" -- a longer-term effort aimed at steadily moving the country on a path toward becoming a NATO member. In line with this aim, the alliance is expected to announce additional steps to boost tactical cooperation and force development in the coming days and financial pledges, as well as a host of security agreements between Ukraine and individual NATO members, according to Biden administration officials. A \"Trump-proof\" NATO? Long before the presidential debate in June, NATO observers have been buzzing about efforts to ensure the alliance can stay the course through political headwinds churned up by changes in leadership. While the alliance's secretary-general, Jens Stoltenberg, is scheduled to step down this fall, much of the attention has been fixed on the U.S. election and what pundits describe as a race to \"Trump-proof\" the alliance, which the former president has repeatedly threatened to leave. (Trump also said in February he wouldn't protect a NATO nation that didn't contribute enough defense funds and, instead, he'd \"encourage\" Russia \"to do whatever the hell they want.\") \"Arguably, despite Russia's continued revanchism, the greatest challenge to NATO today comes from within the alliance -- particularly rising populism and publics that continue to question the value of the alliances -- rather than from adversaries abroad,\" said Raphael S. Cohen, a senior political scientist at the RAND Corporation. He argues that addressing that challenge relies on individual members meeting NATO's guidelines calling for each country to commit at least 2% of its GDP to defense spending -- a target 23 of its 32 members are currently meeting. \"It could change not only many American perceptions of the value of NATO but also change European security -- if not global security -- for the better,\" Cohen said. But members of the administration who believe a second Trump term in office would do irrevocable harm to the alliance say there's only so much that NATO can do to minimize the impact. Multiple U.S. officials aligned with Biden told ABC News that although the summit isn't shaping up to be the celebration of the president's foreign policy accomplishments that they anticipated, they hope the summit will draw attention to how a Trump victory in November could damage America's standing internationally.

        "text": "LYON, France (AP) \u2014 A French court ruled on Monday that the American man accused of sexually assaulting a Pennsylvania college student in 2013 and later sending her a Facebook message that said, \u201cSo I raped you,\u201d can be extradited to the United States. Ian Cleary, 31, of Saratoga, California, was detained in April in the city of Metz in northeastern France after a three-year search. He has been held in custody pending extradition proceedings since his arrest. The Court of Appeal in Metz said that Cleary can be extradited. When asked if he wished to be extradited or not, in line with French law, Cleary refused, prosecutors said in a statement Monday. His refusal may delay the extradition process, but it won\u2019t stop it. The ruling is final. Cleary\u2019s case is now the responsibility of the French Justice Ministry, which must prepare and submit the extradition order for the French prime minister. While he awaits the prime minister\u2019s signature, Cleary remains detained in France. Justice Ministry officials didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment. Cleary had been the subject of an international search since authorities in Pennsylvania issued a 2021 felony warrant in the case weeks after an Associated Press story detailed the reluctance of local prosecutors to pursue campus sex crimes. The arrest warrant accuses Cleary of stalking an 18-year-old Gettysburg College student at a party, sneaking into her dorm and sexually assaulting her while she texted friends for help. He was a 20-year-old Gettysburg student at the time, but didn\u2019t return to campus. The Gettysburg accuser, Shannon Keeler, had a rape exam done the same day she was assaulted in 2013. She gathered witnesses and evidence and spent years urging officials to file charges. She went to authorities again in 2021 after discovering the Facebook messages that seemed to come from Cleary\u2019s account. \u201cSo I raped you,\u201d the sender had written in a string of messages. \u201cI\u2019ll never do it to anyone ever again.\u201d \u201cI need to hear your voice.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll pray for you.\u201d The AP doesn\u2019t typically identify sexual assault victims without their permission, which Keeler has granted. The accuser\u2019s lawyer in Pennsylvania, reached on Monday, declined to comment on the development. According to the June 2021 warrant, police verified that the Facebook account used to send the messages belonged to Ian Cleary. Adams County District Attorney Brian Sinnett, who filed it, declined to comment on developments when reached Monday. After leaving Gettysburg, Cleary earned undergraduate and graduate degrees from Santa Clara University, near his family home in California, worked for Tesla, and then moved to France for several years, according to his website, which describes his self-published medieval fiction. Keeler, originally from Moorestown, New Jersey, stayed on to graduate from Gettysburg and help lead the women\u2019s lacrosse team to a national title. By 2023, two years after the warrant was filed, Keeler and her lawyers wondered how he was avoiding capture in the age of digital tracking. The U.S. Marshals Service thought he was likely overseas and on the move, even as he was the subject of an Interpol alert called a red notice. Across the U.S., very few campus rapes are prosecuted, both because victims fear going to police and prosecutors hesitate to bring cases that can be hard to win, the AP investigation found. Keeler, when the warrant was issued, said she was grateful, but knew it only happened \u201cbecause I went public with my story, which no survivor should have to do in order to obtain justice.\u201d ___ Dale reported from Philadelphia.",

        "text": "Alec Baldwin\u2019s trial in the shooting of a cinematographer is set to begin Tuesday with the selection of jurors who will be tasked with deciding whether the actor is guilty of involuntary manslaughter. Getting chosen to serve in a trial of such a major star accused of such a major crime would be unusual even in Los Angeles or Baldwin\u2019s hometown of New York. But it will be essentially an unheard-of experience for those who are picked as jurors in Santa Fe, New Mexico, though the state has increasingly become a hub of Hollywood production in recent years. Baldwin, 66, could get up to 18 months in prison if jurors unanimously decide he committed the felony when a revolver he was pointing at cinematographer Halyna Hutchins went off, killing her and wounding director Joel Souza during a rehearsal for the Western film \u201cRust\u201d in October 2021 at Bonanza Creek Ranch, some 18 miles (29 kilometers) from where the trial is being held. Baldwin has said the gun fired accidentally after he followed instructions to point it toward Hutchins, who was behind the camera. Unaware the gun contained a live round, Baldwin said he pulled back the hammer \u2014 not the trigger \u2014 and it fired. The star of \u201c30 Rock\u201d and \u201cThe Hunt for Red October\u201d made his first appearance in the courtroom on Monday, when Judge Mary Marlowe Summer, in a significant victory for the defense, ruled at a pretrial hearing that Baldwin's role as a co-producer on \u201cRust\u201d isn't relevant to the trial. The judge has said that the special circumstances of a celebrity trial shouldn't keep jury selection from moving quickly, and that opening statements should begin Wednesday. \u201cI\u2019m not worried about being able to pick a jury in one day,\u201d Marlowe Summer said. \u201cI think we\u2019re going to pick a jury by the afternoon.\u201d Special prosecutor Kari Morrissey, however, was dubious that Baldwin's lawyers, with whom she has clashed in the run-up to the trial, would make that possible. \u201cIt is my guess that with this group of defense attorneys, that\u2019s not gonna happen,\u201d Morrissey said at the hearing. Baldwin attorney Alex Spiro replied, \u201cI\u2019ve never not picked a jury in one day. I can\u2019t imagine that this would be the first time.\u201d Dozens of prospective jurors will be brought into the courtroom for questioning Tuesday morning. Cameras that will carry the rest of the proceedings will be turned off to protect their privacy. Jurors are expected to get the case after a nine-day trial. Attorneys will be able to request they be dismissed for conflicts or other causes. The defense under state law can dismiss up to five jurors without giving a reason, the prosecution three. More challenges will be allowed when four expected alternates are chosen. Before Marlowe Sommer's ruling Monday, prosecutors had hoped to highlight Baldwin\u2019s safety obligations on the set as co-producer to bolster an alternative theory of guilt beyond his alleged negligent use of a firearm. They aimed to link Baldwin\u2019s behavior to \u201ctotal disregard or indifference for the safety of others\" under the involuntary manslaughter law. But the prosecution managed other wins Monday. They successfully argued for the exclusion of summary findings from a state workplace safety investigation that placed much of the blame on the film's assistant director, shifting fault away from Baldwin. And the judge ruled that they could show graphic images from Hutchins' autopsy, and from police lapel cameras during the treatment of her injuries. ___ Dalton reported from Los Angeles.",

        "text": "Alec Baldwin\u2019s trial in the shooting of a cinematographer is set to begin Tuesday with the selection of jurors who will be tasked with deciding whether the actor is guilty of involuntary manslaughter. Getting chosen to serve in a trial of such a major star accused of such a major crime would be unusual even in Los Angeles or Baldwin\u2019s hometown of New York. But it will be essentially an unheard-of experience for those who are picked as jurors in Santa Fe, New Mexico, though the state has increasingly become a hub of Hollywood production in recent years. Baldwin, 66, could get up to 18 months in prison if jurors unanimously decide he committed the felony when a revolver he was pointing at cinematographer Halyna Hutchins went off, killing her and wounding director Joel Souza during a rehearsal for the Western film \u201cRust\u201d in October 2021 at Bonanza Creek Ranch, some 18 miles (29 kilometers) from where the trial is being held. Baldwin has said the gun fired accidentally after he followed instructions to point it toward Hutchins, who was behind the camera. Unaware the gun contained a live round, Baldwin said he pulled back the hammer \u2014 not the trigger \u2014 and it fired. The star of \u201c30 Rock\u201d and \u201cThe Hunt for Red October\u201d made his first appearance in the courtroom on Monday, when Judge Mary Marlowe Summer, in a significant victory for the defense, ruled at a pretrial hearing that Baldwin's role as a co-producer on \u201cRust\u201d isn't relevant to the trial. The judge has said that the special circumstances of a celebrity trial shouldn't keep jury selection from moving quickly, and that opening statements should begin Wednesday. \u201cI\u2019m not worried about being able to pick a jury in one day,\u201d Marlowe Summer said. \u201cI think we\u2019re going to pick a jury by the afternoon.\u201d Special prosecutor Kari Morrissey, however, was dubious that Baldwin's lawyers, with whom she has clashed in the run-up to the trial, would make that possible. \u201cIt is my guess that with this group of defense attorneys, that\u2019s not gonna happen,\u201d Morrissey said at the hearing. Baldwin attorney Alex Spiro replied, \u201cI\u2019ve never not picked a jury in one day. I can\u2019t imagine that this would be the first time.\u201d Dozens of prospective jurors will be brought into the courtroom for questioning Tuesday morning. Cameras that will carry the rest of the proceedings will be turned off to protect their privacy. Jurors are expected to get the case after a nine-day trial. Attorneys will be able to request they be dismissed for conflicts or other causes. The defense under state law can dismiss up to five jurors without giving a reason, the prosecution three. More challenges will be allowed when four expected alternates are chosen. Before Marlowe Sommer's ruling Monday, prosecutors had hoped to highlight Baldwin\u2019s safety obligations on the set as co-producer to bolster an alternative theory of guilt beyond his alleged negligent use of a firearm. They aimed to link Baldwin\u2019s behavior to \u201ctotal disregard or indifference for the safety of others\" under the involuntary manslaughter law. But the prosecution managed other wins Monday. They successfully argued for the exclusion of summary findings from a state workplace safety investigation that placed much of the blame on the film's assistant director, shifting fault away from Baldwin. And the judge ruled that they could show graphic images from Hutchins' autopsy, and from police lapel cameras during the treatment of her injuries. ___ Dalton reported from Los Angeles.",

        "text": "BYD is ramping up its quest for global EV dominance.The Chinese EV giant, which briefly overtook Elon Musk's company as the world's top seller of EVs last year, has struck a deal to build a $1 billion factory in Turkey.According to a statement shared on X by Turkey's minister of industry and technology, Mehmet Fatih, the factory is slated to begin production by the end of 2026 and will have capacity to produce around 150,000 vehicles a year.Business Insider contacted BYD for comment but didn't immediately hear back.It's BYD's second planned factory in Europe and could provide the company with a route around the punishing tariffs the European Union imposed on Chinese EV firms last month.Turkey is part of the EU's Customs Union, and any BYD cars manufactured there could avoid the 17.4% additional tariff the EU slapped on BYD vehicles imported from China.BYD and its rivals are walking a fine line as they rapidly expand globally, even as Western governments launch crackdowns to try and protect their own auto industries from a wave of cheap Chinese imports.Building factories and moving production locally may be one way to circumvent tough trade restrictions, though it's possible new rules will be established to prevent this. Plans by Chinese EV giants BYD, MG, and Chery to build factories in Mexico have sparked concern among US officials over fears they could be used as a \"backdoor\" into the US market.Philip Nothard, insight and strategy director at automotive consultancy Cox Automotive, told Business Insider that BYD's latest move was proof of the Chinese carmaker's ambitious plans for international and European investment.\"Although tariffs may create slight bumps in the road, the likes of BYD, Chery, and others have a strategy that means they can react swiftly to any challenges,\" he said.\"These moves are as much about supply chains, local resource efficiencies, and international growth as they are about tariffs,\" Nothard added.BYD's growing presence in Europe is another potential headache for Elon Musk.Tesla, which has a gigafactory in Germany, counts Europe as one of its most important markets \u2014 but the automaker, which imports certain models to Europe from China, has also been hit by the EU's China crackdown and warned earlier this year that prices of the Model 3 in Europe could rise as a result.Tesla is locked in a global struggle for sales with BYD, with a recent report from auto research firm Counterpoint indicating that Tesla is set to be overtaken by its Chinese rival as the world's largest seller of EVs later this year.",

If the Convicted Felon wins, we lose our Democracy. Joe Biden has effectively served US with honor, decency, and dignity. It's time for Joe Biden to step down,\" Reiner, the When Harry Met Sally... director wrote on X on Monday.Hastings and his wife, Patty Quillin, have been longtime Biden supporters, donating more than $1.5 million to Biden during his 2020 presidential race, but they have suspended their endorsement.\"Biden needs to step aside to allow a vigorous Democratic leader to beat Trump and keep us safe and prosperous,\" Hastings said in an email to The New York Times.Moore, who directed Bowling for Columbine, shared his thoughts on his podcast.\"This is about whether he should serve another four days,\" Moore said on his Rumble podcast.\"If I have to be the only one to stand for Joe Biden\u2014that's right, you heard me say that\u2014if I have to be the only one to stand up for Joe Biden here, to protect him from the cruelest form of elder abuse I've ever been forced to watch, well then that's what I'll do,\" Moore said.\"He was in epic distress that Thursday night.

        "text": "Will Ferrell's legal first name is not Will, and it bothered him at the start of every school year as a kid. When Ferrell, 56, appeared on Christina Applegate and Jamie-Lynn Sigler's MeSsy podcast on Tuesday, July 9, to discuss the 20th anniversary of the pair's comedy classic Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy, he confessed to Applegate, 52, that he felt embarrassed when people would address him as John, his legal first name, when he was growing up. After Applegate asked Ferrell, who rose to fame as a Saturday Night Live cast member in the 1990s, whether he always liked being part of groups growing up, he recalled that he felt \"being funny was an easy way to make friends\" as a kid before bringing up his real name. \"This is a minor thing in terms of \u2014 it's not really even trauma \u2014 but I remember feeling so embarrassed because my real name is John, John William Ferrell, so first day of school, I'd be John. The teacher would be like 'John Ferrell?' and it was so embarrassing to me to have to say 'Here, but I go by Will, I don't go by John.' \" Ferrell described having to wait through the first week of school before his teachers would remember he went by Will as \"excruciating to me.\" \"It wasn't my choice,\" he said, when Applegate asked about his disdain for the name John. \"My parents named [me] John but they called me Will. I grew up as Will, but on a rule sheet, my legal name is John Ferrell.\" \"I don't know why that was so embarrassing to me to have to explain 'I'm actually Will,' \" he added, noting that other children would usually ask him about his name after hearing him correct teachers each school year.

Ferrell starred as anchorman Ron Burgundy, while Applegate portrays Veronica Corningstone, a new addition to the team and eventual love interest. \"At the end of the day, Christina just checked all the boxes \u2014 between funny, smart, tough, because we needed Veronica to stand up to these doofuses, and she was the smartest person in the room,\" Ferrell said of casting Applegate in the movie elsewhere during the podcast.",

        "text": "Despite the fact that Americans buy more electric bicycles than electric cars, widespread adoption of electric motorcycles still lags well behind both. Part of the sluggish sales pace likely comes down to high prices, but as tech continues to evolve, e-moto sticker shock will eventually subside. Lower prices will only enhance the obvious benefits of electrifying motorbikes: silent operation, quick and easy charging, fewer moving parts to service, and a smaller footprint while commuting. In the meantime, one of the most interesting concepts on the market today comes courtesy of a company called Verge, in Finland, with an utterly baffling hubless rear-wheel motor design. As usual with bleeding-edge tech, Verge's first model, the TS, commands a serious premium: a base TS starts at $26,900, and the mid-level TS Pro adds $3,000 to that, while the TS Ultra ramps all the way up to $49,900. I recently test-rode an early TS Pro that Verge shipped to the United States, hoping to prove whether this hubless rear motor truly deserves a future in the industry or simply represents another over-priced gimmick. Riding hard over the weather-beaten roads of Malibu served as an excellent way to explore the potential of the hubless rear wheel. But first, one of Verge's engineers helped me wrap my head around how, exactly, that eye-popping hubless system actually functions. How it works Essentially, the design uses a larger-diameter hub integrated into the swingarm, housing copper-coil electromagnets. Two large ball bearings then support a carbon-fiber rear wheel\u2014developed in-house\u2014with traditional magnets inside the rim. Sending power into the hub's electromagnets causes the wheel's magnets to spin and the wheel to rotate around the motor-hub unit. Thanks to the rear motor, the heaviest component of the bike\u2014the battery\u2014can now ride lower in the chassis. My TS Pro's battery holds 20.2 KWH of charge and the TS Ultra slightly more, at 21.8 kWh, but both weigh around 220 lbs (110 kg). The entire bike is air-cooled, to save more weight, so three 3.5-inch (90 mm) fans help keep the batteries at optimum temps during stop-and-go traffic or while parked. The rear motor is also finned to do the same. That battery still contributes to a curb weight of 540 lbs (245 kg) but allows the TS Ultra to manage a claimed range of 233 miles (375 km) in the city, or 134 miles (215 km) highway. The TS Pro drops those figures to 217 and 124 miles, respectively, (349 and 200 km), but throughout my morning on the bike, the remaining range figure never dipped below 150 miles (241 km). And that's despite plenty of hard pulls and top-speed testing, the exact kind of riding when electric motorcycle range typically fares worst. The hubless design also significantly reduces driveline losses, vibrations, and the loud noise caused by traditional chains, belts, or driveshafts, while allowing Verge's unbelievable maximum output ratings of 885 lb-ft (1,200 Nm) of torque for the Ultra, or \"just\" 737 lb-ft (1,000 Nm) for my Pro. Four selectable ride modes make that torque figure less intimidating. I started out in Zen mode, figuring I should take it easy and give myself a chance to acclimate. Even before pulling away, the low center of gravity became immediately apparent. I just shifted my hips around, feet still on the ground, and moved the bike around with ease despite the hefty overall weight. The same held true while riding at a reasonable pace on Mulholland Drive, as I quickly realized that my body's 170 pounds (77 kg) while hanging off the seat mattered far less than leaning the bike itself. The fact that I immediately started to think about sliding off the saddle points to Verge's impressive integration of digital control. Adjusting to the throttle modulation, the dual handlebar brake levers, and the TS's overall geometry took up less of my mental effort than expected. And yet, I also immediately noticed the rear suspension, which was one of my main questions for Verge before hopping on. Placing a motor and magnetized wheel on a beefed-up swingarm adds to the suspension system's unsprung mass. When I brought this up, the Verge engineer replied that unsprung weight matters less than how to cope with unsprung weight\u2014hence the beefy \u00d6hlins suspension components, front and rear. And yet, I still felt more feedback through the rear tire than on any bike I've ridden previously. The shock absorber and spring manage weight and smaller cracks in the road, but larger undulations do result in some rafting effects. On my own Verge, I might fiddle with the easy adjustability to soften up the damping. Beast mode Instead, on the fly, I swapped into Beast mode, which opens up the maximum 737 lb-ft of torque while dropping traction control intervention (though not to absolute zero since electric motors produce so much torque at almost zero revs). The \"throttle\" modulation also adjusts accordingly in Beast mode\u2014Verge purposefully toned down response to my right hand's twists, so I needed to reach about a quarter of total wrist action before the bike simply launched down the road. And yet, I never power-wheelied either, even while yanking as hard as possible. Verge's in-house traction and wheelie control programming aim to prevent any unintended consequences or ill-advised shenanigans. The dual four-piston Brembo brake calipers up front pair with a custom rear caliper and regenerative braking to help rein in so much power with ease. But I actually found that I preferred fiddling around in My Mode, with the torque set about halfway at 450 lb-ft (610 Nm) and regenerative braking set to full. This level brings on a bit of that gut-punch acceleration but without going overboard on narrow mountainous roads. At that power output, twisting on and off between power and maximum regen can produce a bit of lurching while leaned over at corner apex, though, so I began trail-braking with my left-hand lever to smooth out the dividing line. The rear brake and motor layout also make pulling off the rear wheel fairly easy: remove just five bolts to uncover the left-side swingarm, take off the license plate, then remove 20 rim bolts to slide the wheel off the motor. No special tools necessary, which fits into the concept of futuristic ease. On the other hand, the yellow paint and most materials slot in at a slightly less premium level than Verge's pricing suggests. I'd go for a matte grey or green paint job to ramp up the aesthetic. For Verge customers, most of the startling price tag clearly goes toward technology: fast-charging capability via Tesla Superchargers will also play a key role in sales, no doubt. Connected to a DC fast charger, Verge claims the Ultra can manage a 150 kW charging rate, and the Pro can do 102 kW, good for 80 percent charge times of 25 and 35 minutes respectively. With AC, the charging rate drops to 7 or 8 kW, sufficient to top up the battery overnight. Verge production and shipping are already underway in Europe, but final homologation testing for the US market means that current lead times for orders sit at about nine months. A new Verge store in the Westfield Century City shopping mall in Los Angeles will offer test rides until customer deliveries can begin. For now, I can confirm the spectacular rear wheel-hub-motor contraption works quite well, that 1,000 Nm (much less 1,200 Nm) of torque on two wheels is absolutely insane, and that no driveline losses help with predictable modulation of e-moto regen, too. Verge plans to release more affordable models using the same rear-motor tech later, and, hopefully with time, the design can also shed precious pounds. Both would undoubtedly help this electric motorcycle, in particular, contribute to more widespread use of such a stellar tool for commuters and enthusiasts alike.",

        "text": "India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi met President Vladimir Putin in Moscow on Tuesday, deepening ties between the two nations as Western leaders gathered at a NATO summit in Washington and Russia stepped up attacks in Ukraine with deadly missile strikes. While leaders \u2014 including President Joe Biden and Britain's newly elected Prime Minister Keir Starmer \u2014 prepared to mark 75 years of the world\u2019s biggest security organization, and reassure Ukraine of NATO's support, Putin and Modi were pictured viewing an exhibition of nuclear technology in space. Modi earlier Tuesday lay a wreath at a war memorial near the Kremlin during his first visit to Russia since Moscow's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. He also met Putin Monday at the start of his two-day trip, shortly after Russian missiles slammed across Ukraine, severely damaging the largest children\u2019s hospital in Kyiv and killing at least 42 people across the country, officials said. While Modi\u2019s trip received wall-to-wall coverage in Russia, coverage of Russia\u2019s deadly attack on Ukraine has been muted. Modi posted photos of his arrival in Moscow on the social media platform X, in both Russian and English, saying he was \u201clooking forward to further deepening the Special and Privileged Strategic Partnership between our nations.\u201d \u201cStronger ties between our nations will greatly benefit our people,\u201d he wrote, also sharing a picture of himself and Putin hugging. Russian state media reported that Putin and Modi would discuss energy ties, including Russia helping India to build more nuclear power plants. Russia has had strong ties with India since the Cold War, and New Delhi\u2019s importance as a key trading partner has grown since war in Ukraine. China and India have become key buyers of Russian oil following sanctions imposed by the United States and its allies that shut most Western markets off to Russian exports. India now gets more than 40% of its oil imports from Russia, according to analysts. Modi last traveled to Russia in 2019, when he attended a forum in the far eastern port of Vladivostok and met with Putin. The leaders also saw each other in September 2022 in Uzbekistan, at a summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization bloc. Under Modi\u2019s leadership, India has avoided condemning Russia\u2019s military action in Ukraine while emphasizing the need for a peaceful settlement. The partnership between Moscow and New Delhi has become fraught, however, as Russia has moved closer to China. Modi notably stayed away from last week\u2019s summit in Kazakhstan of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, a security grouping founded by Moscow and Beijing. A confrontation in June 2020 along the disputed China-India border dramatically altered their already touchy relationship as rival troops fought with rocks, clubs and fists. At least 20 Indian soldiers and four Chinese soldiers were killed. Tensions have persisted despite talks \u2014 and have seeped into how New Delhi looks at Moscow. But Modi is expected to seek to continue close relations with Russia, which is also a major defense supplier for India. With Moscow\u2019s arms industries mostly serving the Russian military in Ukraine, India has been diversifying its defense procurements, buying more from the U.S., Israel, France and Italy. Trade development also will figure strongly in the talks, particularly intentions to develop a maritime corridor between India\u2019s major port of Chennai and Vladivostok, the gateway to Russia\u2019s Far East. India-Russia trade has seen a sharp increase, touching close to $65 billion in the 2023-24 financial year, due to strong energy cooperation, Indian Foreign Secretary Vinay Mohan Kwatra told reporters Friday. Imports from Russia touched $60 billion and exports from India $4 billion in the 2023-24 financial year. India\u2019s financial year runs from April to March.",

        "text": "BERLIN\u2014The NATO summit begins in Washington, D.C., on Tuesday amid the turmoil of President Joe Biden\u2019s campaign for the presidency and what the future holds for Ukraine. One of the worst missile attacks of the war in Ukraine occurred Monday, where 41 people were killed and at least 190 were injured, and the country\u2019s largest children\u2019s hospital, Okhmatdyt in Kyiv, was bombarded, leaving medical staff and sick children trapped under the rubble. There were images of emergency workers rushing to provide life-saving medical treatment to small children and bodies scattered throughout the site of the attack. On the 75th anniversary of NATO, this summit comes at a time when the organization must prove its worth in standing up to the Russian threat. And Russian President Vladimir Putin is busy reminding NATO members exactly why the union needs to be strengthened with the deadly bombardment of Kyiv and a whistle-stop tour in recent weeks of some of the world\u2019s least democratic leaders. \u201cThis is a fully deliberate action, specifically designed and approved by\u2026 Putin. On the eve of the @Nato summit. As a slap in the face to the alliance,\u201d wrote Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to the Ukrainian president on X. The situation in Ukraine is dire, as the Kremlin continues to attack the country, and Russia\u2019s counter-offensive in the Kharkiv region is underway. A crucial topic for Ukraine at the summit will be the details of an aid package that includes vital air defense systems meant to protect Ukrainian cities. However, it is unclear how well the new air defense will help. Eastern cities like Kharkiv are so close to the Russian border that air raid sirens and air defense systems often do not have enough time to start because it takes just seconds for the Kremlin\u2019s missiles to make an impact on the city. In small villages near the front, there is essentially no warning before attacks begin. Kyiv\u2019s air defense system has managed to protect the capital city from many attacks, but a resident named Anastasiia Orlova told The Daily Beast, \u201cLast year, our air defense in Kyiv was stronger; not many missiles made it to Kyiv. Now, we are lacking air defense. While in the European Union and U.S. there are hundreds of Patriot air defense systems just gathering dust in warehouses or standing on military bases unused. The place that really needs them now [is] Ukraine, [and it] gets just a minimum amount.\u201d \u201cFor each system, we really need to beg at places like NATO summits or during official visits of our president. What\u2019s the point of all these constant meetings and summits when kids fighting cancer are the targets of Russian missiles?\u201d she added, referencing the attack at Okhmatdyt. Although NATO is not arming Ukraine directly, members are expected to pledge to provide at least four additional Patriot missile batteries to Ukraine at the end of the summit. The new military aid package to Ukraine is also expected to include $43 billion in 2025 in aid to the country. It is believed that NATO will also establish a new military command in the German city of Wiesbaden, which plans to coordinate military aid and training in Ukraine. Although new aid is expected, a Ukrainian soldier serving on the Donbas front, who asked to be referred to as \u201cEddie,\u201d said that he does not know if the proposed aid will truly help Ukraine. The new air defense aid is said to be \u201cfuture proof\u201d for Ukraine, but Eddie told The Daily Beast: \u201cWe hope those are not empty words. I hope it [defense systems] will help to avoid things like yesterday [attack] [and help] with few clinics and hospitals, including [the] children\u2019s hospital yesterday.\u201d \u201cWe need shells and jets to fight off Russian bombers,\u201d he added. For the entirety of the war, Ukraine has stressed the importance of the country being allowed to join NATO, something that members have repeatedly denied. This time around, Ukraine will still not get its wish, but inviting Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to the summit shows NATO\u2019s support for Kyiv nonetheless. Russia is watching on intently from the sidelines\u2014on Tuesday, Dmitry Peskov, Putin\u2019s spokesman, told journalists that Moscow would follow the summit: \u201cWith the greatest attention... the rhetoric at the talks and the decisions that will be taken and put on paper,\u201d according to the Moscow Times. The summit comes at a time when Russia\u2019s supporters are on the rise. Recently, the Prime minister of Hungary, Viktor Orb\u00e1n, visited Putin on what he claimed was a \u201cpeace mission.\u201d Orb\u00e1n is said to be Europe\u2019s most pro-Russian leader and had just come from a visit to Kyiv\u2014he plans to be a \u201cpeace broker\u201d between the two countries. Putin also recently strengthened its ties with North Korea\u2019s dictator, Kim Jong-un, and the pair agreed to sign a deal that included a mutual defense package that made one message clear\u2014any attack from Ukraine on Russia would be an attack on North Korea. In China, Putin met with the country\u2019s leader, Xi Jinping, and the two hailed their partnership. In televised remarks, Putin said the relationship between Moscow and Beijing has a \u201cComprehensive partnership and strategic cooperation are experiencing their best period in history.\u201d On Monday, Putin welcomed Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to Moscow. India is believed to be an important relationship for the U.S., but Modi\u2019s visit showed that his friendship with Putin is strong as well. Russia\u2019s deep ties with Asian countries have proved that Moscow is not alone in its war against Ukraine, and the Kremlin hopes it\u2019s biggest potential ally might be coming soon\u2014Donald Trump. In Kyiv, Orlova said, \u201cI am very worried about what will happen with Trump. He wants to sign a peace treaty with a war criminal, like signing a peace treaty with Hitler. Ukraine already signed the Minsk Agreement,\u201d the treaty aimed to end the initial phase of Russia\u2019s invasion during its 2014 war in Donbas. \u201cShould we give more land now where our people are living under occupation? Where they are tortured and afraid to speak? I wish he would come to Ukraine, and maybe some humanity in his soul would wake up,\u201d she added.",

        "text": "SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) \u2014 Alec Baldwin\u2019s trial in the shooting of a cinematographer is set to begin Tuesday with the selection of jurors who will be tasked with deciding whether the actor is guilty of involuntary manslaughter. Getting chosen to serve in a trial of such a major star accused of such a major crime would be unusual even in Los Angeles or Baldwin\u2019s hometown of New York. But it will be essentially an unheard-of experience for those who are picked as jurors in Santa Fe, New Mexico, though the state has increasingly become a hub of Hollywood production in recent years. Baldwin, 66, could get up to 18 months in prison if jurors unanimously decide he committed the felony when a revolver he was pointing at cinematographer Halyna Hutchins went off, killing her and wounding director Joel Souza during a rehearsal for the Western film \u201cRust\u201d in October 2021 at Bonanza Creek Ranch, some 18 miles (29 kilometers) from where the trial is being held. Baldwin has said the gun fired accidentally after he followed instructions to point it toward Hutchins, who was behind the camera. Unaware the gun contained a live round, Baldwin said he pulled back the hammer \u2014 not the trigger \u2014 and it fired. The star of \u201c30 Rock\u201d and \u201cThe Hunt for Red October\u201d made his first appearance in the courtroom on Monday, when Judge Mary Marlowe Summer, in a significant victory for the defense, ruled at a pretrial hearing that Baldwin\u2019s role as a co-producer on \u201cRust\u201d isn\u2019t relevant to the trial. The judge has said that the special circumstances of a celebrity trial shouldn\u2019t keep jury selection from moving quickly, and that opening statements should begin Wednesday. \u201cI\u2019m not worried about being able to pick a jury in one day,\u201d Marlowe Summer said. \u201cI think we\u2019re going to pick a jury by the afternoon.\u201d Special prosecutor Kari Morrissey, however, was dubious that Baldwin\u2019s lawyers, with whom she has clashed in the run-up to the trial, would make that possible. \u201cIt is my guess that with this group of defense attorneys, that\u2019s not gonna happen,\u201d Morrissey said at the hearing. Baldwin attorney Alex Spiro replied, \u201cI\u2019ve never not picked a jury in one day. I can\u2019t imagine that this would be the first time.\u201d Dozens of prospective jurors will be brought into the courtroom for questioning Tuesday morning. Cameras that will carry the rest of the proceedings will be turned off to protect their privacy. Jurors are expected to get the case after a nine-day trial. Attorneys will be able to request they be dismissed for conflicts or other causes. The defense under state law can dismiss up to five jurors without giving a reason, the prosecution three. More challenges will be allowed when four expected alternates are chosen.

But the prosecution managed other wins Monday. They successfully argued for the exclusion of summary findings from a state workplace safety investigation that placed much of the blame on the film\u2019s assistant director, shifting fault away from Baldwin.

        "text": "Alec Baldwin\u2019s trial in the shooting of a cinematographer is set to begin Tuesday with the selection of jurors who will be tasked with deciding whether the actor is guilty of involuntary manslaughter. Getting chosen to serve in a trial of such a major star accused of such a major crime would be unusual even in Los Angeles or Baldwin\u2019s hometown of New York. But it will be essentially an unheard-of experience for those who are picked as jurors in Santa Fe, New Mexico, though the state has increasingly become a hub of Hollywood production in recent years. Baldwin, 66, could get up to 18 months in prison if jurors unanimously decide he committed the felony when a revolver he was pointing at cinematographer Halyna Hutchins went off, killing her and wounding director Joel Souza during a rehearsal for the Western film \u201cRust\u201d in October 2021 at Bonanza Creek Ranch, some 18 miles (29 kilometers) from where the trial is being held. Baldwin has said the gun fired accidentally after he followed instructions to point it toward Hutchins, who was behind the camera. Unaware the gun contained a live round, Baldwin said he pulled back the hammer \u2014 not the trigger \u2014 and it fired. The star of \u201c30 Rock\u201d and \u201cThe Hunt for Red October\u201d made his first appearance in the courtroom on Monday, when Judge Mary Marlowe Summer, in a significant victory for the defense, ruled at a pretrial hearing that Baldwin's role as a co-producer on \u201cRust\u201d isn't relevant to the trial. The judge has said that the special circumstances of a celebrity trial shouldn't keep jury selection from moving quickly, and that opening statements should begin Wednesday. \u201cI\u2019m not worried about being able to pick a jury in one day,\u201d Marlowe Summer said. \u201cI think we\u2019re going to pick a jury by the afternoon.\u201d Special prosecutor Kari Morrissey, however, was dubious that Baldwin's lawyers, with whom she has clashed in the run-up to the trial, would make that possible. \u201cIt is my guess that with this group of defense attorneys, that\u2019s not gonna happen,\u201d Morrissey said at the hearing. Baldwin attorney Alex Spiro replied, \u201cI\u2019ve never not picked a jury in one day. I can\u2019t imagine that this would be the first time.\u201d Dozens of prospective jurors will be brought into the courtroom for questioning Tuesday morning. Cameras that will carry the rest of the proceedings will be turned off to protect their privacy. Jurors are expected to get the case after a nine-day trial. Attorneys will be able to request they be dismissed for conflicts or other causes. The defense under state law can dismiss up to five jurors without giving a reason, the prosecution three. More challenges will be allowed when four expected alternates are chosen. Before Marlowe Sommer's ruling Monday, prosecutors had hoped to highlight Baldwin\u2019s safety obligations on the set as co-producer to bolster an alternative theory of guilt beyond his alleged negligent use of a firearm.

They successfully argued for the exclusion of summary findings from a state workplace safety investigation that placed much of the blame on the film's assistant director, shifting fault away from Baldwin. And the judge ruled that they could show graphic images from Hutchins' autopsy, and from police lapel cameras during the treatment of her injuries. ___ Dalton reported from Los Angeles.",

        "text": "\u2018NO CHANGE IN OUR POLICY\u2019: While President Volodymyr Zelensky travels to Washington for the NATO summit celebrating 75 years of the alliance, Ukraine today is in a day of mourning after Russia launched its heaviest bombardment of the country in months on Monday. While the attacks targeted six areas of Ukraine, one particularly heart-wrenching strike was by a Russian cruise missile on a children\u2019s hospital in Kyiv, where seriously ill children are treated for cancer and other life-threatening health problems. \u201cAs of now, at least 37 people have been killed, including three children, and 170 injured, including 13 children,\u201d Zelensky said in a post on X. In remarks in Poland yesterday, Zelensky underscored Ukraine\u2019s desperate need for more air defenses, such as the U.S.-made Patriot system, but again renewed his plea for President Joe Biden to lift restrictions on the use of U.S. weapons to strike deeper into Russia. \u201cWe need, in addition to air defense, and I think we have raised this issue more than once, the possibility of using our partner\u2019s weapons to target the particular military bases and sites that Russia uses to launch attacks on Ukraine,\u201d Zelensky said. \u201cI think this is a decision we would like to see from our partners.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s been no change in our policy,\u201d John Kirby, national security communications adviser, said at the White House. \u201cThe president several weeks ago gave guidance to Ukraine that they can use U.S.-supplied weapons to strike targets just over the border. That\u2019s still the case.\u201d \u2018DEBRIS FELL INTO HEART PATIENTS\u2019 OPEN CHESTS\u2019: In a statement, Biden called the hospital strike \u201ca horrific reminder of Russia\u2019s brutality.\u201d At this week\u2019s summit, Biden stated that allies will announce \u201cnew measures to strengthen Ukraine\u2019s air defenses.\u201d \u201cI will be meeting with President Zelensky to make clear our support for Ukraine is unshakeable,\u201d Biden said. The U.N. Security Council has scheduled an emergency meeting on the attacks. However, the council\u2019s rotating presidency is currently held by Russia, which denies targeting the hospital and is blaming an errant Ukrainian air defense missile for the carnage. Ukraine\u2019s Security Service said wreckage of a Russian Kh-101 cruise missile was recovered at the site. \u201cWe are sure it was a Russian attack,\u201d spokesman Matthew Miller said at the State Department. \u201cJust to be clear, these are sites that serve no military purpose. They\u2019re not sheltering Ukrainian military assets, they\u2019re not sheltering members of the Ukrainian military. These are civilian infrastructure, pure and simple, that cannot, should not, must not be targets of military attacks.\u201d \u201cThe attack on the Okhmatdyt Children\u2019s hospital caused debris to fall into heart patients\u2019 open chests in the middle of surgery,\u201d the Associated Press said in a dispatch from Kyiv. \u201cCancer patients had their beds wheeled into parks and onto the streets.\u201d \u201cAs if we needed another reminder, this evil and barbaric attack shows the high moral cost of the Biden administration\u2019s failure to supply Ukraine with the munitions and defenses it needs,\u201d said Sen. Roger Wicker (R-MS), ranking Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee, in a statement. \u201cThe world has known at least since February 22, 2022, that Vladimir Putin is a war criminal. His bombing of a children\u2019s hospital on Sunday only reinforces that reality.\u201d \u2018NATO IS IN UKRAINE\u2019S FUTURE\u2019: While Ukraine will not be getting an invitation to join NATO, reports indicate that a draft communique to be issued at the summit refers to Ukraine\u2019s eventual membership as \u201cirreversible.\u201d \u201cAnd you\u2019re going to see \u2026 some discussion about Ukraine\u2019s path to NATO and what that can look like,\u201d Kirby said at yesterday\u2019s White House briefing. \u201cAnd a reaffirmation of what the president has long said \u2014 that NATO is in Ukraine\u2019s future.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll just tell you that you\u2019re going to see some announcements on air defense. You\u2019re going to see some announcements on deterrence capabilities, not just with respect to helping Ukraine, but boosting the alliance,\u201d Kirby said. \u201cYou\u2019re going to see some announcements with respect to the defense industrial base and how to shore up that and make it more resilient and invest in it more, including in our own industrial base here in the United States.\u201d Good Tuesday morning and welcome to Jamie McIntyre\u2019s Daily on Defense, written and compiled by Washington Examiner National Security Senior Writer Jamie McIntyre (@jamiejmcintyre) and edited by Stacey Dec.

And be sure to follow me on Threads and/or on X @jamiejmcintyre HAPPENING TODAY: President Joe Biden will welcome NATO leaders tonight at an event at the Andrew Mellon Auditorium, site of the original signing of the North Atlantic Treaty, which established NATO on April 4th, 1949. Article 10 of the North Atlantic Treaty states that NATO membership is open to any \u201cEuropean State in a position to further the principles of this Treaty and to contribute to the security of the North Atlantic area.\u201d Biden\u2019s remarks marking the 75th anniversary of the alliance \u2014 which has grown from 12 founding members to 32 today \u2014 are scheduled for 5 p.m. BIDEN TO MEET UK\u2019S NEW PM: Biden is taking advantage of the gathering of NATO leaders in Washington to meet one-on-one tomorrow with new British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, whose Labour party won a landslide election last week. Biden \u201cwill underscore the importance of continuing to strengthen the special relationship between the United States and the United Kingdom,\u201d the White House said in a statement. \u201cThe leaders will have the opportunity to discuss in depth U.S.-UK cooperation across a range of issues, including support to Ukraine, advancing a free and open Indo-Pacific, reaching a ceasefire and hostage release deal in Gaza, ensuring that Iran can never obtain a nuclear weapon, and strengthening the coalition to confront Iranian-backed Houthi threats to commercial shipping.\u201d TOO BIG TO FAIL: The Air Force program to replace Cold War-era Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missiles with the new LGM-35A SentinelICBM has been beset by delays and cost overruns. The latest problems reported in January have forced the Pentagon to grant the program a special dispensation to a law that would otherwise require the program be killed. The cost of the replacement ICBM has ballooned to $140.9 billion, an increase of 81%. Under a law known as Nunn-McCurdy, any increase over 30% is considered \u201ccritical\u201d and requires the secretary of defense to either cancel the program or declare it absolutely necessary for national security. \u201cToday I am certifying that the Sentinel program meets the statutory criteria to continue, but it is important to note that this certification does not indicate business as usual,\u201d William LaPlante, undersecretary of defense for acquisitions and sustainment, said at a Pentagon briefing. \u201cThe program will be restructured to address the root causes of the breach and ensure an appropriate management structure is in place to control costs.\u201d SENATE NDAA FILED: Leaders of the Armed Services Committee have formally filed the Senate version of the 2025 National Defense Authorization Act, and Sen. Roger Wicker (R-MS), the committee\u2019s ranking Republican, is calling for quick action on the annual policy bill. The bill authorizes $911.8 billion in defense, $25 billion over the caps set by law. \u201cSenator Wicker will continue making the case that if President Biden\u2019s budget can call for $76 billion above the spending caps, then the U.S. Congress can discuss increasing defense spending,\u201d Wicker\u2019s office said in a press release. \u201cThe world\u2019s greatest deliberative body should get a chance to work its will on the floor, and I hope more of my colleagues will join me in continuing the national conversation about investing more,\u201d Wicker said in calling for Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) to bring the bill to the floor for debate. \u201cThe Senate Armed Services Committee sent a bipartisan signal that we must return to \u2018peace through strength,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cThe new axis of aggressors and their threats are already upon us.

        "text": "WASHINGTON -- Leaders of NATO countries will open their annual summit on July 9 in Washington to discuss ways to bolster the alliance's defense capabilities and support Ukraine against the backdrop of political uncertainty in the host country and Russia's intense bombing of Ukraine. NATO is expected to announce plans for European members to boost spending on weapons and ammunition procurement following years of underinvestment as well as a 40 billion-euro ($43 billion) aid package for Ukraine. The agenda of the three-day summit, which will mark NATO's 75th anniversary, will be partially overshadowed by concerns about U.S. President Joe Biden's age and ability to lead after his chances of winning reelection this November took a hit following his dismal debate performance against Republican contender Donald Trump last month. Support and aid to Ukraine is likely to take on even greater immediacy at the summit following one of the worst Russian air attacks on the country since the Kremlin launched the full-scale invasion in February 2022. The barrage of missiles fired across Ukraine on July 8 struck several civilian facilities, including Kyiv's Okhmatdyt Children's Hospital, killing at least 41 people in total and injuring scores more in what Biden called a \"horrific reminder of Russia's brutality.\" Michael Carpenter, senior director for NATO at the National Security Council, told reporters on July 8 that the allies will announce new measures to bolster Ukraine's security, including air defense and F-16 fighter jets, but he did not give any details. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has for months pleaded with NATO members for more air defense, especially the U.S.-made Patriot missile system, to defend its troops, cities, and infrastructure against large-scale Russian bombing campaigns. The alliance will also announce a new NATO military command in Germany to coordinate the training and equipping of Ukrainian troops and station a senior NATO representative in Kyiv. However, the summit will not extend an invitation for Ukraine to join the alliance. Carpenter said there was still no consensus on the issue among the 32 allies. The NATO communique is expected to say that Ukraine belongs in the alliance without giving a time frame for when it will join. NATO members also couldn't agree on a multiyear military aid package for Ukraine that outgoing Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg had proposed. Instead, NATO will announce a one-year, 40 billion-euro package. Biden and Zelenskiy will meet on July 11 and be joined by the leaders of about two dozen other countries that have signed bilateral security agreements with Ukraine. Biden last month signed a 10-year agreement that calls on the United States, among other things, to help bolster Ukraine's military-industrial complex through co-production and joint ventures with U.S. industry. The expected announcements have disappointed some Western supporters of Ukraine who want greater aid and a clearer path into NATO. \"I don't see this summit doing much for Ukraine at all,\" Kurt Volker, who served as U.S. ambassador to NATO in 2008-09 and former special envoy to Ukraine in 2017-19, told the Center for a New American Security earlier this month. But Carpenter said the commitments made to Ukraine during the summit will show that Russian President Vladimir Putin's strategy of outlasting the alliance won't work. NATO unity on Ukraine, however, will be challenged at the summit by Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, whose pro-Russian views have irked the alliance. Orban, who just took over the rotating presidency of the EU, flew to Moscow last week without informing the bloc ahead of time to discuss an end to the war with Putin. The trip was denounced by Zelenskiy, the EU, and the Biden administration. NATO Spending Defense spending by NATO members will be another hot topic at the summit. NATO members committed a decade ago to reach a defense spending target of at least 2 percent of gross national product by 2024. Stoltenberg said that 23 of the alliance's 32 members will meet that target this year. \"One of the things you'll see at the summit, certainly behind closed doors, is that there'll be a lot of allies holding each other's feet to the fire in terms of defense spending commitments,\" Carpenter said. U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson (Republican-Louisiana), a Trump ally, said on July 8 that Republicans \"celebrate the peace and stability that NATO has secured...but we also believe that NATO needs to be doing more.\" Some Western officials say 2 percent should be a floor, not a ceiling, and that NATO members should be spending 2.5 percent or more amid growing threats from Russia, China, and Iran. \"If we look into the future, and we look into fully resourcing our defense plans and preparing for all possible contingency, this will require for a number of countries to go beyond 2 percent,\" Benedetta Berti, head of policy planning in the office of the NATO secretary-general. Johnson, who spoke at the Hudson Institute, a Washington think tank, said Republicans were pushing for a \"self-reliant European defense industrial base.\" Trump harangued NATO allies when he was president for not meeting their spending commitments, threatening at one point to withdraw the United States from the alliance. Biden's poor debate performance and the specter of another Trump presidency has many European allies worried. But National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said the White House had not picked up any signed from allies that they need to \"be reassured of American leadership and President Biden's commitments.\" Strengthening ties with Asian partners to contain China will be another topic at the summit. NATO allies will be joined by the leaders of four Asian countries, including Japan, South Korea, Australia, and New Zealand. NATO members have criticized China for supplying Russia with electronics used in weapons production. \"The global threats and challenges we face, including from authoritarian actors and terrorist organizations, are all inextricably linked,\" Carpenter said. For Stoltenberg, the summit is expected to be his last major event before he departs the alliance on October 1. He will be replaced by Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte.

How quickly can you solve it? Play now! Winkler\u2019s story comes after he had to be evacuated from The Shelbourne hotel in Dublin, Ireland in June due to a fire. The star arrived at the hotel the night before the fire occurred on the fifth floor of the 19th-century hotel at 10:38 a.m. local time. Sharing a snap on Instagram, Winkler posed with firefighters as they stood outdoors following the evacuation. \u201cDublin\u2019s finest does a great job when our hotel is evacuated on our first morning !!!!,\u201d his caption read. Back in February, Winkler reunited with his Happy Days costar Ron Howard \u2014 who played Richie Cunningham \u2014 at Winkler\u2019s event in Sydney Australia for his memoir Being Henry: The Fonz...and Beyond. \u201cLIFE!

SO exciting for everyone !!!!\u201d Winkler, 78, wrote on X (formerly known as Twitter) alongside a snap of the two. Reposting Winkler\u2019s tweet, Howard, 70, wrote, \u201cJust started post-production in Sydney on my recently wrapped latest movie @edenthemovie starring an amazing cast.\u201d \u201cA great creative experience but that\u2019s for another post,\u201d he added on X. \u201cWhen I touched base with Henry, I discovered he was making an appearance here in support of his excellent best-selling memoir #BeingHenry: The Fonz...and Beyond.

        "text": "SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) \u2014 Alec Baldwin\u2019s trial in the shooting of a cinematographer is set to begin Tuesday with the selection of jurors who will be tasked with deciding whether the actor is guilty of involuntary manslaughter. Getting chosen to serve in a trial of such a major star accused of such a major crime would be unusual even in Los Angeles or Baldwin\u2019s hometown of New York. But it will be essentially an unheard-of experience for those who are picked as jurors in Santa Fe, New Mexico, though the state has increasingly become a hub of Hollywood production in recent years. Baldwin, 66, could get up to 18 months in prison if jurors unanimously decide he committed the felony when a revolver he was pointing at cinematographer Halyna Hutchins went off, killing her and wounding director Joel Souza during a rehearsal for the Western film \u201cRust\u201d in October 2021 at Bonanza Creek Ranch, some 18 miles (29 kilometers) from where the trial is being held. Baldwin has said the gun fired accidentally after he followed instructions to point it toward Hutchins, who was behind the camera. Unaware the gun contained a live round, Baldwin said he pulled back the hammer \u2014 not the trigger \u2014 and it fired. The star of \u201c30 Rock\u201d and \u201cThe Hunt for Red October\u201d made his first appearance in the courtroom on Monday, when Judge Mary Marlowe Summer, in a significant victory for the defense, ruled at a pretrial hearing that Baldwin\u2019s role as a co-producer on \u201cRust\u201d isn\u2019t relevant to the trial. The judge has said that the special circumstances of a celebrity trial shouldn\u2019t keep jury selection from moving quickly, and that opening statements should begin Wednesday. \u201cI\u2019m not worried about being able to pick a jury in one day,\u201d Marlowe Summer said. \u201cI think we\u2019re going to pick a jury by the afternoon.\u201d Special prosecutor Kari Morrissey, however, was dubious that Baldwin\u2019s lawyers, with whom she has clashed in the run-up to the trial, would make that possible. \u201cIt is my guess that with this group of defense attorneys, that\u2019s not gonna happen,\u201d Morrissey said at the hearing. Baldwin attorney Alex Spiro replied, \u201cI\u2019ve never not picked a jury in one day. I can\u2019t imagine that this would be the first time.\u201d Dozens of prospective jurors will be brought into the courtroom for questioning Tuesday morning. Cameras that will carry the rest of the proceedings will be turned off to protect their privacy. Jurors are expected to get the case after a nine-day trial. Attorneys will be able to request they be dismissed for conflicts or other causes. The defense under state law can dismiss up to five jurors without giving a reason, the prosecution three. More challenges will be allowed when four expected alternates are chosen. Before Marlowe Sommer\u2019s ruling Monday, prosecutors had hoped to highlight Baldwin\u2019s safety obligations on the set as co-producer to bolster an alternative theory of guilt beyond his alleged negligent use of a firearm. They aimed to link Baldwin\u2019s behavior to \u201ctotal disregard or indifference for the safety of others\u201d under the involuntary manslaughter law. But the prosecution managed other wins Monday. They successfully argued for the exclusion of summary findings from a state workplace safety investigation that placed much of the blame on the film\u2019s assistant director, shifting fault away from Baldwin. And the judge ruled that they could show graphic images from Hutchins\u2019 autopsy, and from police lapel cameras during the treatment of her injuries. ___ By MORGAN LEE and ANDREW DALTON Associated Press Dalton reported from Los Angeles.",

The scene, on Monday evening, opened the Indian leader\u2019s two-day trip to Russia and illustrated a sobering reality: Despite the West\u2019s intended isolation of Russia over its 2022 invasion of Ukraine, other nations have pursued their own interests with regard to Moscow, helping Mr. Putin shore up Russia\u2019s economy and wage its war. While Mr. Modi was hugging the Russian leader, rescue workers in Kyiv were searching for survivors under the rubble of Ukraine\u2019s largest pediatric hospital in the wake of a Russian missile attack. President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine called Mr. Modi\u2019s embrace a \u201chuge disappointment\u201d and a \u201cdevastating blow to peace efforts.\u201d The arrival in Russia of the leader of the world\u2019s largest democracy has given Mr. Putin further evidence that he has avoided the pariah status Western leaders tried to force on him after the invasion.

But are those results the ones that you deeply desire, that would make you happiest, or the ones you really need? You deserve more than \u201cgreat\u201d results. You deserve the best! I want to help you take your results to a whole new level. Much more is possible for your life than just the success you\u2019ve been striving for and told you \u201cshould\u201d experience. I invite you to stop \u201cshould-ing\u201d on yourself and start setting intentions\u2014where you take your awareness about yourself or a situation and focus it\u2014to guide your thoughts, emotions and actions toward a desired outcome. An intention is your objective and your purpose behind why you\u2019re doing something. It ensures you don\u2019t operate from a place of autopilot or old patterns that don\u2019t serve you. It allows you to come from a place of clarity and truth, so you can experience the most fulfilling and beneficial outcome. You might think this is woo-woo if you\u2019ve heard the phrase in yoga or guided meditation, but there is science to explain how this practice can help you thrive versus just survive as you white-knuckle your way to \u201csuccess.\u201d It includes using your conscious mind to influence your subconscious mind where most of your behavior stems from, so you\u2019re inspired to act in a way that leads to your best outcomes. Below I share why setting intentions works and how to use a proprietary guide I created with five questions to get exceptional results while enjoying every step of the way.

Gaining Clarity Setting an intention helps you gain clarity about your desired results and focus your attention. It gives you a sense of direction and purpose so your brain knows what to pay attention to and looks for opportunities that align with your desires. On our journey, we can feel fear, overwhelm and doubt. It\u2019s difficult to stop feeling that way. But you can shift your awareness to what you want versus what you don\u2019t want. This focus can lead you in the direction of your desired results. There is a part of our brain called the RAS\u2014reticular activating system\u2014that helps. It filters for information based on your focus, priming your mind to look for steps and evidence that support you. When I began searching for hearing aids, there was so much information online plus from the insurance company and audiologists. I felt paralyzed in making a decision that would best suit my needs. I almost gave up on my search. Instead, I created an intention to find the best hearing experience at an affordable price. I also had a deeper intention to create awareness around hearing loss and solutions. With this clarity, I honed the questions I needed to ask as I went through a trial pair of hearing aids including adjustments and conversations with my insurance company. With each step, I got closer to my best solutions. Remaining Present There can be obstacles to staying on track given the stimulation in this world with triggers that can bring up old patterns or a desire for dopamine hits. We need to make sure our brains are in a calm state so we remain present. Then our subconscious network can receive the important messages for the best solution. If you\u2019re triggered or overstimulated, your sympathetic nervous system is activated. Your flight/freeze/fawn/fight response shuts down the part of your brain that can consider possibilities. You\u2019re in survival mode, can feel anxious and behave in a way where you miss the answers you need to hear in the moment. So it\u2019s important to activate your parasympathetic nervous system, where we have access to memories and experiences that support us in feeling good so we can engage with others in a positive way. Being clear about my desire to create awareness around hearing loss and solutions inspired me to talk about hearing aids and even wear a device around my neck to help operate them. Wearing it did that\u2014but it also helped my mission! My neighbor saw me wearing it, told me she worked for a competitor and asked if I wanted to try her brand's hearing aids. I tried and liked them and eventually got them for free! Detaching From The Outcome Although being clear on what you desire is key, you can\u2019t get attached to the outcome. An intention sets the direction and focus, but it doesn\u2019t limit you because my process includes questions that lead to who you need to \u201cbe\u201d to get these results which inspires authentic actions versus what you think you \u201cshould do.\u201d With genuine intentions, you can attract the results you need in the moment, the ones that are best for you and ultimately the most remarkable. With my hearing aids journey, I knew I needed to be open and confident. Clarity about my mission to have a good hearing experience and create awareness around solutions while being open to possibilities versus anxious or doubting myself led me to multiple international speaking engagements and communications about hearing solutions.

        "text": "From an exciting new mansion to an unprecedented travel twist, The Bachelorette\u2018s Season 21 premiere was full of surprises \u2014 including Jenn Tran\u2019s decision to only kiss one man. Longtime members of Bachelor Nation know that Night 1 is often full of first impression pecks, serious smooches, and the occasional full-on make-out session. But as Tran\u2019s first official night on Bachelorette duty progressed, she decided she wanted to save her first kiss for the right moment and the right guy. \u201cGoing into that first night, I didn\u2019t really have a plan, but I\u2019ve seen the show a couple times and I\u2019ve seen how many people kiss,\u201d Tran told Decider in a Zoom interview ahead of her premiere. \u201cI think that for me, a first kiss means a lot. It takes a lot for me to be affectionate with somebody and to get to that level. So I knew in the back of my head that I wasn\u2019t going to kiss anybody unless I really felt that spark and felt that connection and felt that the relationship could go to that level that night.\u201d Tran\u2019s first (and only!) kiss of the night went to Sam McKinney, a 27-year-old contractor from Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, who accepted her first impression rose shortly before the first rose ceremony. On Night 1, Sam M. walked up to Tran and asked her to picture her life 50 years from now, waking up on a Saturday morning to him cooking breakfast and asking \u2014 with two shots in his hands \u2014 \u201cDo you know what time it is?\u201d The \u201cshot o\u2019clock\u201d reference was a smooth nod to Jenn\u2019s Bachelor Season 28 finale speech, and though Sam M. was incredibly naive to think he\u2019d be the only guy making his first impression with a shots joke, he did snag the rose, so he clearly did something right! Sam was also the first to steal Tran for a second after her Night 1 welcome toast, and after the two bonded over their desire for a \u201cferocious\u201d and \u201creckless\u201d love, Tran told cameras she felt there was an \u201cundeniable connection\u201d between them. Later in the evening, she took Sam aside with first impression rose in hand. \u201cI feel like there has been something there, and I can\u2019t stop thinking about you all night,\u201d Tran shared. \u201cI don\u2019t always pick the right men, but there is something in my gut that\u2019s just telling me there\u2019s something here. And I\u2019m really excited about it and I\u2019m really excited to get to know you a lot more. I can\u2019t stop thinking about you.\u201d After Sam accepted the first impression rose, Tran went in for the kiss, which turned into a \u201cferal\u201d smooching session that they both admitted they \u201ccould get used to.\u201d When looking back on her first kiss with Decider, Tran said, \u201cI didn\u2019t know how many people I was going to kiss, but I was happy with myself for following my gut and for really just listening to myself.\u201d Later in our interview, Tran also revealed that her celebrity crushes are Shawn Mendes and Chris Evans, and with Sam M\u2019s chiseled jaw, facial hair, and \u201cTop Gun 3\u201d movie star good looks, it makes sense that he made quite the first impression. We\u2019ll have to wait and see who gets Tran\u2019s second kiss \u2014 and if Sam M. makes it to the end of Tran\u2019s journey or not \u2014 but whatever happens, the Season 21 lead teased a surprising season ahead. \u201cIt\u2019s a surprise for sure. It\u2019s definitely not something that I could have imagined was going to happen. But I\u2019m very happy with the way everything panned out through the journey. And I\u2019m very excited for it all to come to light,\u201d she said, promising a lot of twists and turns. \u201cI was constantly surprised every day. And I was on the edge of my seat a lot of the time.\u201d New episodes of The Bachelorette Season 21 premiere Mondays at 8 p.m. ET on ABC with next-day streaming on Hulu. Be sure to read Decider\u2019s pre-premiere interview with Jenn Tran for a preview of the season ahead.",

        "text": "We're used to Bill Maher throwing curve balls, but in May he delivered a real doozy. On his podcast, \"Club Random,\" he told guest Jerry Seinfeld that he may retire from the stand-up circuit before the end of the year. That means his appearance at Minneapolis' Orpheum Theatre on Saturday, as part of the WTF? Tour, may be a farewell to local fans. Maher has a long association with the Twin Cities. He filmed his first HBO special at St. Paul's Fitzgerald Theater in 1995 and has kept returning to the market like clockwork. He chatted recently by phone about possibly giving up road gigs, the success of his new book, \"What This Comedian Said Will Shock You,\" and why this 22nd season of HBO's \"Real Time With Bill Maher\" won't be his last. Q: I was surprised when you said you might give up stand-up because I know how much you love it. I always assumed you would give up the TV show first. A: I love them both. It's like having two kids. You don't know which one you love more. I would miss stand-up, but the travel is getting to me. But I don't want to make any formal announcement and then wake up and say, 'What the hell was I thinking?' I don't want to be like The Who or the Eagles. Remember when they said they wouldn't reunite until hell freezes over \u2014 and then they named their comeback tour, Hell Freezes Over? I loved that. At least they owned it. I think I could do TV as long as they will have me. I'm still at the top of my game. I'll be 70 in a year and a half. Mick Jagger is on tour now. He's 80 and the reviews are great. And comedy is not like music. I don't have to jump around and be sexy. I look at the news, give you a point of view and make you laugh. I don't know why I can't do that when I'm 80. Q: You got into the podcast game kind of late. What made you decide to do it and how have you made it different from the hundreds of other podcasts that comics are doing? A: We did make it different. Very different. Podcasts are usually stage-y and brightly lit. It looks like they are on a set with everyone wearing headsets and a producer looking things up on a computer. On mine, no one else is in the room. Cameras are built into the walls. It's exactly what it's like sitting around and smoking pot with me. Q: And then there's the book. Because it's a collection of the editorials you've done at the end of \"Real Time,\" I'll bet a lot of people think it was just a matter of regurgitating old material. I assume it was a lot more work than that. A: It was a labor of love. Thank God for the strike or I wouldn't have had time to do it. Just reading them from the past 10 or 15 years took a lot of time. Then I had to cull the best from that and put them in an order that made sense, update a lot of stuff and get rid of redundancies. But I'm glad I did it. It's every good thing I said in one book. Q: I always wonder if David Letterman ever got tired of having to do the Top 10 List. Are there parts of \"Real Time\" that you wish you could blow up? A: The pandemic forced us to go from three guests on the panel to two, which was good. Three was too crowded. But it'd be silly to blow up the format. Show business is tough, even when you're at your best. My advice to kids is that if you're doing something well, stick to that. I comment on the news of the day. That's cake that nobody else has. Q: I think you have one of the smallest writing staffs of any late-night TV. Why not have more contributors? Make it easier on yourself? A: The other shows have a head writer, who everyone submits to and then he picks out the best stuff, submits it to the star of the show, and then it's culled even further. I never liked to work that way. I'm my own head writer. I like to read every word. So you can't have a lot of writers. I can't absorb that much material. I always tell them, \"Be brave. I can always edit stuff out.\" We have a Really File, where we put jokes that make me go, \"Really? You thought I was going to say that on TV out loud? I'd be canceled tomorrow.\" But that's OK. I would rather they go way out there because I can always pull them back in. Q: There are weeks where you seem to have become the darling of Fox News. What's it like to be embraced occasionally from a media outlet that you've been so tough on? A: It's so amusing to me. I'll do a show where 80 percent of the material is knocking the right, but they don't show that. They focus on the one thing they love. That's my big complaint about corporate media. You never hear the full story. I definitely don't look at cable news anymore. I used to watch the nightly news on the networks, but I can't even take that anymore. It's so much water-cooler video, like a bear in someone's hot tub. An airline had a rocky landing. So what? Call me when they die. I get my information by reading a couple newspapers. My psyche is better that way. Q: A lot of the other late-night hosts seem to be best pals. You get the sense that they go skiing together on weekends. Why aren't you part of that club? A: I don't know if it's a club. I love the Jimmys. I just saw Jimmy Fallon last month. I love Jimmy Kimmel as a person. Stephen Colbert? No, we're not friends, but we're not enemies. All those guys, their points of views are all interchangeable. When it comes to politics, they could do each other's jokes. I'm going to give you something completely different. I'm not constrained. Q: Is that why \"Real Time\" has never won an Emmy? A: I'm not going to get into that. The reason we haven't won an Emmy is not because it wasn't the best show. It might be because it is the best, because it's the bravest show, but that's not what's rewarded. The Emmy voters are virtue signalers and my politics doesn't jibe with theirs. Q: Who would you love to have on the show that hasn't come on yet? A: I could start with Bill Clinton, Arnold Schwarzenegger. So many celebrities think they're not smart enough. Well, maybe they're not smart enough for \"Real Time,\" I give you that, but they can come on the podcast. That's not really about politics. But publicists are always protecting their people from me. It's so frustrating. Q: If this does end up being your last stand-up show in Twin Cities, it's going to end a pretty long tradition. A: It does bring back memories. Right after that HBO special in 1995, I took a Midwestern vacation with my girlfriend at the time. We rented a car and saw Mount Rushmore and the Badlands, which is like the Grand Canyon that needs a better publicist. I've never done anything like that before or since. Some of it was corny, but it was cool. What can I say? I love America. Bill Maher: The WTF? Tour When: 8 p.m. Sat. Where: Orpheum Theatre, 910 Hennepin Av. S., Mpls.

        "text": "Even before Russian President Vladimir Putin landed in Pyongyang for his first trip to North Korea in nearly a quarter century, foreign policy observers were pontificating about what Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un might have up their sleeves. Was the Putin-Kim summit an inflection point in the world order? Did the signing of the Comprehensive Strategic Partnership Agreement mean that Moscow and Pyongyang were now officially allies? And if so, how should the United States react? The commentary thus far has taken on an almost hysterical turn. Victor Cha, a former National Security Council director for Asian affairs, has alleged that Russia and North Korea are now embarking on \u201c a full-fledged military alliance\u201d similar to what both countries had during the Cold War. President Joe Biden\u2019s administration views the renewed Russia-North Korea partnership as an extremely dangerous arrangement that should be of concern to anybody who cares about stability on the Korean Peninsula or about saving Ukraine from Russian revanchism. Some of these comments are justifiable. U.S. officials are right to raise concerns. But to be perfectly blunt, the sky isn\u2019t falling. A strategic path First, it\u2019s vital to understand why Putin and Kim have chosen the path they\u2019re now on. For Russia, the calculations are relatively straightforward: Russian foreign policy is now dictated entirely by the ongoing war in Ukraine. Every move made on the international scene is motivated by one question: Does it help or hurt the war effort? With respect to North Korea, the answer is lopsidedly in the \u201chelps\u201d column. North Korea has proved indispensable for Moscow at a time when the Russian army needs all the military aid it can get to maintain its lines during the upcoming summer fighting season. According to the U.S. State Department, North Korea has delivered 11,000 containers of munitions to Russia since September, a huge supplement to Russia\u2019s own domestic military production. To the extent Putin can formalize this military-to-military cooperation, he is going to do it. For North Korea, institutionalizing the strategic relationship with Russia offers several dividends. First, the North Koreans receive items, such as food aid, crude oil and natural gas that Kim needs in the immediate term or, in the case of Russian military technology, covets in order to ensure his military satellite program isn\u2019t a bust. Second, by signing a deal with Moscow, the North Koreans are communicating to Washington, Seoul and Tokyo that their emerging trilateral relationship \u2014 one Pyongyang suspects is designed to stifle what little power it has \u2014 will have consequences. Third and most notable over the long term, getting closer to Russia gives the Kim dynasty greater flexibility in the region by lessening its dependence on China. It\u2019s no surprise that Beijing has been quite muted on the whole arrangement since it was consummated last month. Mutual defense Much has been made about the mutual defense provision in Putin and Kim\u2019s partnership accord. Article 4 stresses that if either Russia or North Korea is subjected to armed aggression and finds itself in a state of war, \u201cthe other party shall immediately provide military and other assistance by all means at its disposal\u201d to counteract it. Some have pointed out that this mutual aid declaration is inspired at least in part by the 1953 U.S.-South Korea Mutual Defense Treaty. Yet while military-to-military cooperation between Moscow and Pyongyang certainly sounds frightening, it isn\u2019t a new development and shouldn\u2019t be treated as such. The two had a similar arrangement during much of the Cold War. The good news is that last month\u2019s deal is weaker than the 1961 Treaty of Friendship. Unlike that Cold War-era treaty, the 2024 comprehensive strategic partnership uses ambiguous wording to ensure neither state is forced to automatically intervene. This wasn\u2019t by accident \u2014 Russia and North Korea don\u2019t want to die for one another\u2019s interests or put themselves in a position in which one has to mindlessly go to war on behalf of the other. Indeed, there is a question as to whether Russia and North Korea would even go through with such a scheme. Stuck in the muddy trenches of Ukraine and sustaining a high rate of casualties every week \u2014 in April, the United Kingdom Ministry of Defense claimed that approximately 450,000 Russian troops have been killed or injured, a number that has risen since then \u2014 Russia isn\u2019t in any position to bail out another country. The Russian army and the entire Russian military-industrial complex is tied up serving the Ukraine front, which means that if a crisis erupted on the Korean Peninsula in the next several years, there isn\u2019t much Moscow could do to mitigate it. To date, the United States and its East Asian allies have responded with a combination of panic and fury. South Korea called Russia\u2019s ambassador in Seoul to task on June 21. And two days later, senior U.S., South Korean and Japanese officials released a joint statement condemning strengthening Russia-North Korea relations and redoubling their commitment to boosting trilateral cooperation. All three capitals, however, would be smart to take a deep breath and stop pretending East Asia is markedly more dangerous today than it was a few weeks ago.

        "text": "SANTA FE, N.M.\u2014Alec Baldwin\u2019s trial in the shooting of a cinematographer is set to begin Tuesday with the selection of jurors who will be tasked with deciding whether the actor is guilty of involuntary manslaughter. Getting chosen to serve in a trial of such a major star accused of such a major crime would be unusual even in Los Angeles or Mr. Baldwin\u2019s hometown of New York. But it will be essentially an unheard-of experience for those who are picked as jurors in Santa Fe, New Mexico, though the state has increasingly become a hub of Hollywood production in recent years. Mr. Baldwin, 66, could get up to 18 months in prison if jurors unanimously decide he committed the felony when a revolver he was pointing at cinematographer Halyna Hutchins went off, killing her and wounding director Joel Souza during a rehearsal for the Western film \u201cRust\u201d in October 2021 at Bonanza Creek Ranch, some 18 miles (29 kilometers) from where the trial is being held. Mr. Baldwin has said the gun fired accidentally after he followed instructions to point it toward Hutchins, who was behind the camera. Unaware the gun contained a live round, Mr. Baldwin said he pulled back the hammer\u2014not the trigger\u2014and it fired. The star of \u201c30 Rock\u201d and \u201cThe Hunt for Red October\u201d made his first appearance in the courtroom on Monday, when Judge Mary Marlowe Summer, in a significant victory for the defense, ruled at a pretrial hearing that Mr. Baldwin\u2019s role as a co-producer on \u201cRust\u201d isn\u2019t relevant to the trial. The judge has said that the special circumstances of a celebrity trial shouldn\u2019t keep jury selection from moving quickly, and that opening statements should begin Wednesday. \u201cI\u2019m not worried about being able to pick a jury in one day,\u201d Judge Marlowe Summer said. \u201cI think we\u2019re going to pick a jury by the afternoon.\u201d Special prosecutor Kari Morrissey, however, was dubious that Mr. Baldwin\u2019s lawyers, with whom she has clashed in the run-up to the trial, would make that possible. \u201cIt is my guess that with this group of defense attorneys, that\u2019s not gonna happen,\u201d Ms. Morrissey said at the hearing. Mr. Baldwin attorney Alex Spiro replied, \u201cI\u2019ve never not picked a jury in one day. I can\u2019t imagine that this would be the first time.\u201d Dozens of prospective jurors will be brought into the courtroom for questioning Tuesday morning. Cameras that will carry the rest of the proceedings will be turned off to protect their privacy. Jurors are expected to get the case after a nine-day trial. Attorneys will be able to request they be dismissed for conflicts or other causes. The defense under state law can dismiss up to five jurors without giving a reason, the prosecution three. More challenges will be allowed when four expected alternates are chosen. Before Judge Marlowe Sommer\u2019s ruling Monday, prosecutors had hoped to highlight Mr. Baldwin\u2019s safety obligations on the set as co-producer to bolster an alternative theory of guilt beyond his alleged negligent use of a firearm. They aimed to link Mr. Baldwin\u2019s behavior to \u201ctotal disregard or indifference for the safety of others\u201d under the involuntary manslaughter law. But the prosecution managed other wins on Monday. They successfully argued for the exclusion of summary findings from a state workplace safety investigation that placed much of the blame on the film\u2019s assistant director, shifting fault away from Mr. Baldwin. And the judge ruled that they could show graphic images from Hutchins\u2019 autopsy, and from police lapel cameras during the treatment of her injuries.",

        "text": "WASHINGTON -- Leaders of NATO countries will open their annual summit on July 9 in Washington to discuss ways to bolster the alliance's defense capabilities and support Ukraine against the backdrop of political uncertainty in the host country and Russia's intense bombing of Ukraine. NATO is expected to announce plans for European members to boost spending on weapons and ammunition procurement following years of underinvestment as well as a 40 billion-euro ($43 billion) aid package for Ukraine. The agenda of the three-day summit, which will mark NATO's 75th anniversary, will be partially overshadowed by concerns about U.S. President Joe Biden's age and ability to lead after his chances of winning reelection this November took a hit following his dismal debate performance against Republican contender Donald Trump last month. Support and aid to Ukraine is likely to take on even greater immediacy at the summit following one of the worst Russian air attacks on the country since the Kremlin launched the full-scale invasion in February 2022. The barrage of missiles fired across Ukraine on July 8 struck several civilian facilities, including Kyiv's Okhmatdyt Children's Hospital, killing at least 41 people in total and injuring scores more in what Biden called a \"horrific reminder of Russia's brutality.\" Michael Carpenter, senior director for NATO at the National Security Council, told reporters on July 8 that the allies will announce new measures to bolster Ukraine's security, including air defense and F-16 fighter jets, but he did not give any details. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has for months pleaded with NATO members for more air defense, especially the U.S.-made Patriot missile system, to defend its troops, cities, and infrastructure against large-scale Russian bombing campaigns. The alliance will also announce a new NATO military command in Germany to coordinate the training and equipping of Ukrainian troops and station a senior NATO representative in Kyiv. However, the summit will not extend an invitation for Ukraine to join the alliance. Carpenter said there was still no consensus on the issue among the 32 allies. The NATO communique is expected to say that Ukraine belongs in the alliance without giving a time frame for when it will join. NATO members also couldn't agree on a multiyear military aid package for Ukraine that outgoing Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg had proposed. Instead, NATO will announce a one-year, 40 billion-euro package. Biden and Zelenskiy will meet on July 11 and be joined by the leaders of about two dozen other countries that have signed bilateral security agreements with Ukraine. Biden last month signed a 10-year agreement that calls on the United States, among other things, to help bolster Ukraine's military-industrial complex through co-production and joint ventures with U.S. industry. The expected announcements have disappointed some Western supporters of Ukraine who want greater aid and a clearer path into NATO. \"I don't see this summit doing much for Ukraine at all,\" Kurt Volker, who served as U.S. ambassador to NATO in 2008-09 and former special envoy to Ukraine in 2017-19, told the Center for a New American Security earlier this month. But Carpenter said the commitments made to Ukraine during the summit will show that Russian President Vladimir Putin's strategy of outlasting the alliance won't work. NATO unity on Ukraine, however, will be challenged at the summit by Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, whose pro-Russian views have irked the alliance. Orban, who just took over the rotating presidency of the EU, flew to Moscow last week without informing the bloc ahead of time to discuss an end to the war with Putin. The trip was denounced by Zelenskiy, the EU, and the Biden administration. NATO Spending Defense spending by NATO members will be another hot topic at the summit. NATO members committed a decade ago to reach a defense spending target of at least 2 percent of gross national product by 2024. Stoltenberg said that 23 of the alliance's 32 members will meet that target this year. \"One of the things you'll see at the summit, certainly behind closed doors, is that there'll be a lot of allies holding each other's feet to the fire in terms of defense spending commitments,\" Carpenter said. U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson (Republican-Louisiana), a Trump ally, said on July 8 that Republicans \"celebrate the peace and stability that NATO has secured...but we also believe that NATO needs to be doing more.\" Some Western officials say 2 percent should be a floor, not a ceiling, and that NATO members should be spending 2.5 percent or more amid growing threats from Russia, China, and Iran. \"If we look into the future, and we look into fully resourcing our defense plans and preparing for all possible contingency, this will require for a number of countries to go beyond 2 percent,\" Benedetta Berti, head of policy planning in the office of the NATO secretary-general. Johnson, who spoke at the Hudson Institute, a Washington think tank, said Republicans were pushing for a \"self-reliant European defense industrial base.\" Trump harangued NATO allies when he was president for not meeting their spending commitments, threatening at one point to withdraw the United States from the alliance. Biden's poor debate performance and the specter of another Trump presidency has many European allies worried. But National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said the White House had not picked up any signed from allies that they need to \"be reassured of American leadership and President Biden's commitments.\" Strengthening ties with Asian partners to contain China will be another topic at the summit. NATO allies will be joined by the leaders of four Asian countries, including Japan, South Korea, Australia, and New Zealand. NATO members have criticized China for supplying Russia with electronics used in weapons production. \"The global threats and challenges we face, including from authoritarian actors and terrorist organizations, are all inextricably linked,\" Carpenter said. For Stoltenberg, the summit is expected to be his last major event before he departs the alliance on October 1. He will be replaced by Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte.

        "text": "An American climber's mummified remains have been found 22 years after he vanished in Peru. On Monday, July 8, the Peruvian National Police released a handout picture showing officers evacuating 59-year-old William Stampfl's body from a mountain in the Ancash region, around 270 miles north of the capital Lima. Police confirmed the climber's clothes were in good condition. Per the AFP, police said the hiker's \"remains were finally exposed by ice melt on the Cordillera Blanca range of the Andes\" more than two decades after he was reported missing in June 2002. The news agency stated that Stampfl vanished after an avalanche hit his group on Mount Huascar\u00e1n, which stands at over 22,000 feet high and is the highest peak in Peru. According to CBS News, the climber's body, including his harness, and boots, were all well-preserved when he was discovered. Peruvian police identified Stampfl by his passport, which was found at the scene, per AFP. The Peruvian authorities didn't immediately respond when contacted by PEOPLE. In November 2023, Peruvian scientists told the Associated Press that the country had lost over half its glacier surface in the past 60 years as average temperatures around the world increased. \u201cIn 58 years, 56.22% of the glacial coverage recorded in 1962 has been lost,\u201d glaciology expert Mayra Mej\u00eda, who is an official with Peru\u2019s National Institute of Research of Mountain Glaciers and Ecosystems (Inaigem), said, per the outlet. Mej\u00eda told the news agency that glaciers had almost disappeared within some of the country's mountain ranges. The discovery of Stampfl's remains comes after a climber named Marta Emilia Altamirano's body was found attached to a glacier in February 2023, nearly 42 years after she suffered an accident while on an expedition in the Andes.

Per The Independent, Altamirano, also known as Patty, died at age 20 in March 1981 after she slipped at around 16,000 feet high before she fell to her death. The outlet stated her sister Corina, who was also on the climb, confirmed the news at the time, but authorities struggled to find Altamirano's remains over the years.",

India\u2019s foreign ministry last month demanded a \u201cverified stop\u201d on the recruitment of its citizens allegedly \u201cmisled\u201d into serving in the Russian army after two Indians were killed fighting in Ukraine. Two Indian nationals had been killed in March as well. Mr Modi brought up the matter during a private dinner hosted by Mr Putin on Monday, news agency PTI reported, citing unnamed sources. The Indian leader is on a two-day visit to Moscow. Russia was expected to formally announce the decision to discharge all Indians from its military following official talks on Tuesday. India had asked Moscow to quickly discharge all Indians working in its military and ensure their safe return while urging its citizens to \u201cexercise caution\u201d in seeking employment in Russia. Randhir Jaiswal, India\u2019s foreign ministry spokesperson, said about 20 people had sought help to return home. Nearly 100 Indian citizens have reportedly been recruited in the Russian military, many of them conned by agents into working as \u201carmy security helpers\u201d, according to a report in The Hindu. A group of men from the western states of Punjab and Haryana dressed in army uniforms recorded a video earlier this year claiming they had been tricked into fighting in the Ukraine war. In May, Indian police arrested four people allegedly linked to an international human trafficking ring involved in tricking workers into fighting in the Ukraine war by offering them lucrative jobs. Mr Modi, making his first bilateral visit to Russia since starting his third time as prime minister, was welcomed by Mr Putin on Monday night. \u201cI look forward to tomorrow\u2019s negotiations which will undoubtedly further strengthen the friendship between India and Russia,\u201d Mr Modi wrote on Twitter/X. The Russian leader showed Mr Modi around his residence outside Moscow on a golf cart ahead of official talks in the Kremlin. \u201cIndia\u2019s relationship with Russia is based on mutual trust and respect,\u201d Mr Modi said while addressing the Indian diaspora in Moscow on Tuesday.",

        "text": "Move over, New York and Paris, Berlin Fashion Week is quickly becoming a place for young designers to see and be seen. Berlin has been doing its thing since 2007. But this year, the German capital showed love to Black designers on July 2 and 3 with Black in Fashion, a pop-up event dedicated to providing a platform for designers of African descent.

        "text": "Zo\u00eb Kravitz spent years working on the script for her directorial debut, and while the story went through many changes during development, the title always remained the same: Pussy Island. But now that the thriller is about to debut in theaters, it's under the new, less provocative title, Blink Twice. Kravitz previously made it clear that she was dedicated to keeping the title Pussy Island, but she now explains to Entertainment Weekly why the name had to change despite her original plan. \"It was made very clear to me that 'p---y' is a word that we, our society, are not ready to embrace yet,\" she says. \"There were a lot of roadblocks along the way, whether it be the MPAA not wanting to put it on a poster, or a billboard, or a kiosk; movie theaters not wanting to put it on a ticket.\" But the issues went deeper than logistics. First-time director Kravitz learned throughout the process of making the movie that the target audience she was trying to reach and empower with the title Pussy Island actually had the opposite reaction. \"Interestingly enough, after researching it, women were offended by the word, and women seeing the title were saying, 'I don't want to see that movie,' which is part of the reason I wanted to try and use the word, which is trying to reclaim the word, and not make it something that we're so uncomfortable using,\" Kravitz says. \"But we're not there yet. And I think that's something I have the responsibility as a filmmaker to listen to. I care about people seeing the film, and I care about how it makes people feel.\" Blink Twice, written by Kravitz and E.T. Feigenbaum, stars Naomi Ackie as Frida, a cocktail waitress tired of being overlooked who gets invited to billionaire tech mogul Slater King's (Channing Tatum) private island for what seems like a nonstop luxurious party. But she soon finds out that paradise isn't all that it seems after her best friend Jess (Alia Shawkat) goes missing, and none of the other partying vacationers seem to care \u2014 or even remember that Jess was there despite meeting her days earlier. The dark drama soon becomes a literal fight for survival. Kravitz began writing the script with Feigenbaum in 2017, and she says she still believes in the original title, even though she had to change it. \"I do believe that Pussy Island was the first thing I wrote down when I wrote this movie, and it's the seed of the film, and the spirit of what that means to me is still alive and very much present in the film,\" she adds. \"And I love the new title. I'm happy with the new title. I think everything happens for a reason, and I think it actually really focuses the movie in a great way. And I think that was always the way it was meant to be.\" Want more movie news?

        "text": "WASHINGTON -- Leaders of NATO countries will open their annual summit on July 9 in Washington to discuss ways to bolster the alliance's defense capabilities and support Ukraine against the backdrop of political uncertainty in the host country and Russia's intense bombing of Ukraine. NATO is expected to announce plans for European members to boost spending on weapons and ammunition procurement following years of underinvestment as well as a 40 billion-euro ($43 billion) aid package for Ukraine. The agenda of the three-day summit, which will mark NATO's 75th anniversary, will be partially overshadowed by concerns about U.S. President Joe Biden's age and ability to lead after his chances of winning reelection this November took a hit following his dismal debate performance against Republican contender Donald Trump last month. Support and aid to Ukraine is likely to take on even greater immediacy at the summit following one of the worst Russian air attacks on the country since the Kremlin launched the full-scale invasion in February 2022. The barrage of missiles fired across Ukraine on July 8 struck several civilian facilities, including Kyiv's Okhmatdyt Children's Hospital, killing at least 41 people in total and injuring scores more in what Biden called a \"horrific reminder of Russia's brutality.\" Michael Carpenter, senior director for NATO at the National Security Council, told reporters on July 8 that the allies will announce new measures to bolster Ukraine's security, including air defense and F-16 fighter jets, but he did not give any details. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has for months pleaded with NATO members for more air defense, especially the U.S.-made Patriot missile system, to defend its troops, cities, and infrastructure against large-scale Russian bombing campaigns. The alliance will also announce a new NATO military command in Germany to coordinate the training and equipping of Ukrainian troops and station a senior NATO representative in Kyiv. However, the summit will not extend an invitation for Ukraine to join the alliance. Carpenter said there was still no consensus on the issue among the 32 allies. The NATO communique is expected to say that Ukraine belongs in the alliance without giving a time frame for when it will join. NATO members also couldn't agree on a multiyear military aid package for Ukraine that outgoing Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg had proposed. Instead, NATO will announce a one-year, 40 billion-euro package. Biden and Zelenskiy will meet on July 11 and be joined by the leaders of about two dozen other countries that have signed bilateral security agreements with Ukraine. Biden last month signed a 10-year agreement that calls on the United States, among other things, to help bolster Ukraine's military-industrial complex through co-production and joint ventures with U.S. industry. The expected announcements have disappointed some Western supporters of Ukraine who want greater aid and a clearer path into NATO. \"I don't see this summit doing much for Ukraine at all,\" Kurt Volker, who served as U.S. ambassador to NATO in 2008-09 and former special envoy to Ukraine in 2017-19, told the Center for a New American Security earlier this month. But Carpenter said the commitments made to Ukraine during the summit will show that Russian President Vladimir Putin's strategy of outlasting the alliance won't work. NATO unity on Ukraine, however, will be challenged at the summit by Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, whose pro-Russian views have irked the alliance. Orban, who just took over the rotating presidency of the EU, flew to Moscow last week without informing the bloc ahead of time to discuss an end to the war with Putin. The trip was denounced by Zelenskiy, the EU, and the Biden administration. NATO Spending Defense spending by NATO members will be another hot topic at the summit. NATO members committed a decade ago to reach a defense spending target of at least 2 percent of gross national product by 2024. Stoltenberg said that 23 of the alliance's 32 members will meet that target this year. \"One of the things you'll see at the summit, certainly behind closed doors, is that there'll be a lot of allies holding each other's feet to the fire in terms of defense spending commitments,\" Carpenter said. U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson (Republican-Louisiana), a Trump ally, said on July 8 that Republicans \"celebrate the peace and stability that NATO has secured...but we also believe that NATO needs to be doing more.\" \u201cEveryone cannot ride along on the coattails of America. And Donald Trump says this as bluntly as anyone. It\u2019s just right and fair for us to demand that others do their part,\u201d he said. The United States accounts for 68 percent of NATO defense spending. Some Western officials say 2 percent should be a floor, not a ceiling, and that NATO members should be spending 2.5 percent or more amid growing threats from Russia, China, and Iran. \"If we look into the future, and we look into fully resourcing our defense plans and preparing for all possible contingency, this will require for a number of countries to go beyond 2 percent,\" Benedetta Berti, head of policy planning in the office of the NATO secretary-general. Johnson, who spoke at the Hudson Institute, a Washington think tank, said Republicans were pushing for a \"self-reliant European defense industrial base.\" Trump harangued NATO allies when he was president for not meeting their spending commitments, threatening at one point to withdraw the United States from the alliance. Biden's poor debate performance and the specter of another Trump presidency has many European allies worried. But National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said the White House had not picked up any signed from allies that they need to \"be reassured of American leadership and President Biden's commitments.\" Strengthening ties with Asian partners to contain China will be another topic at the summit. NATO allies will be joined by the leaders of four Asian countries, including Japan, South Korea, Australia, and New Zealand. NATO members have criticized China for supplying Russia with electronics used in weapons production. \"The global threats and challenges we face, including from authoritarian actors and terrorist organizations, are all inextricably linked,\" Carpenter said. For Stoltenberg, the summit is expected to be his last major event before he departs the alliance on October 1. He will be replaced by Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte.

        "text": "When Alec Baldwin\u2019s manslaughter trial begins Tuesday, he\u2019ll be armed with top-gun defense lawyers, the power of his outsized celebrity and a possible scapegoat: Hannah Gutierrez-Reed, the \u201cRust\u201d armorer already serving time in a New Mexico prison for the accidental shooting death of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins. But Baldwin\u2019s path to avoiding a similar fate \u2013 Gutierrez-Reed was hauled off by deputies just minutes after her March 6 guilty verdict was read before a shocked courtroom \u2013 is precarious and narrow, legal experts have told TheWrap. Especially since Baldwin was the one holding the gun. The infamous October 2021 incident on the low-budget Western near Santa Fe netted Gutierrez-Reed\u2019s conviction, as well as a guilty plea on a misdemeanor negligence charge from assistant director David Halls. Baldwin, as the last crew member to face criminal justice for the \u201cRust\u201d disaster, also has the advantage of having seen the lion\u2019s share of the state\u2019s evidence already. And on Monday, the judge overseeing the case gave Baldwin a small legal victory when she declared that prosecutors could not present evidence of his role as co-producer. The state had intended to argue that in that position, Baldwin failed as overseer of set safety, beyond just recklessly pointing guns as an actor. But that\u2019s where Baldwin\u2019s advantages seem to run out. Never-before-seen set footage presented as evidence during the Gutierrez-Reed trial showed clip after clip of Baldwin\u2019s cavalier handling of weapons, including barking orders at his crew to hastily reload, and another where he uses a gun as a \u201cpointing stick\u201d to move cast and crew around. And the jury can also see the outcomes for Halls and Gutierrez-Reed as a foundation for the idea that this was more than just a tragic accident, legal experts say. Since the incident well over two years ago, Baldwin has been free on bail and has not shied from the spotlight. He told ABC News\u2019 George Stephanopoulos in a tearful interview just weeks later that he didn\u2019t pull the trigger, has maintained that position \u2013 and his innocence \u2013 ever since. And Baldwin and wife Hilaria, who share seven children, announced last month that they will debut a new reality series, \u201cThe Baldwins,\u201d on TLC sometime in 2025. Jury selection was slated to begin Tuesday, with the trial expected to last two weeks or more. Baldwin, expected in the courtroom daily, faces up to 18 months in jail with possible fines; he also faces multiple civil cases in California and New Mexico.",

        "text": "Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday attended a Moscow event promoting family values, sparking anger as a missile hit a children's hospital in Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, causing multiple civilian casualties.On July 8, Russia celebrates its Family, Love, and Fidelity Day, a holiday \"dedicated to preserving family values,\" the website of the ruling United Russia party says. Putin in 2022 signed a decree giving the celebration official status. \"For us, for the state, there can be nothing more important than strengthening the family,\" Putin said Monday as he met participants of a competition for Russian children.Across the border in neighboring Ukraine, Russia launched one of its deadliest attacks of the year, its troops sending a barrage of missiles to hit targets across the country, including the Okhmatdyt Children's Hospital in Kyiv. At least 38 people were killed and 190 were injured nationwide.A day of mourning is being observed in the country as a result of the attacks. Searches were still ongoing on Tuesday for survivors trapped beneath rubble at Ukraine's largest pediatrics facility.Russia denied targeting the children's hospital, saying on Monday that debris from a Ukrainian air-defense missile hit the facility. Ukraine said the Russians used a Kh-101 cruise missile to attack the site. Ukraine's Security Service said it had found wreckage from the weapon.\"The experts' conclusions are unequivocal \u2013 it was a direct strike,\" Ukraine's State Security Service said on Telegram. Newsweek has as yet been unable to verify this.Putin said in Moscow on Monday: \"If you went to this competition, a family competition, it means that you not only felt like a family team, but were also ready to work together to achieve a common goal. Nothing unites people like working together to achieve a common result.\"Putin's celebration of Russia's Family, Love, and Fidelity Day against the backdrop of the deadly attacks sparked negative reactions on social media.\"While russian missiles were flying at hospitals in Ukraine, putin spoke at the closing of the russia exhibition and promised new benefits for large families on the occasion of Family Day,\" said pro-Ukrainian X (formerly Twitter) user J\u00fcrgen Nauditt, who posts regular updates about the war.\"Putin who is known to love Ukrainian children so much that he stole thousands of them, hosted event 'promoting family values' after bombing children's hospital in [Kyiv],\" another X user wrote.In an emailed statement to Newsweek, United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker T\u00fcrk deplored Russia's missile strikes on Ukraine.\"Shockingly, one of the strikes severely damaged the intensive care, surgical and oncology wards of Okhmatdyt, which is Ukraine's largest children's referral hospital, and destroyed its children's toxicology department, where children receive dialysis,\" T\u00fcrk said. \"Among the victims were Ukraine's sickest children.\"T\u00fcrk added: \"There must be prompt, thorough and independent investigations into these latest grave attacks on civilians and civilian infrastructure, and those responsible must be held to account.\"Do you have a tip on a world news story that Newsweek should be covering?

        "text": "By Andrew Osborn MOSCOW (Reuters) - It boasts a replica of the 'Tsar Bomba', the most powerful nuclear bomb ever tested, slick presentation stands extolling the virtues of four Ukrainian regions Russia says it has annexed, and artwork lionising the Russian army in Ukraine. After organisers said over 18 million people had flocked to Moscow's \"Russia\" exhibition in eight months, making it one of the top 10 visited places on the planet, President Vladimir Putin has decreed it will become a permanent landmark. Originally conceived as a temporary Kremlin-backed project designed to fuel patriotism and promote the authorities' view of Russia's past, present and future, Putin, on his fifth visit to the exhibition on Monday, told an audience there: \"We have things to show off, we have things to be proud of, but that's not all. It's also important to present it all with talent and beauty. We need to create the conditions to show what the country is doing, how it is living, and what we need to achieve. That's why... we've agreed to set up a national centre.\" The move is emblematic of a drive by Putin to unite Russians behind him at a time of war when the Kremlin is promoting a single, strong patriotic narrative and punishing those who dissent from it. Critics have been branded \"foreign agents\" or extremists, and some have been handed long jail terms for discrediting the armed forces or spreading \"fake news\" about the war. The \"Russia\" exhibition opened its doors in the run-up to the election in March this year which handed Putin a fifth presidential term. It has since served as a venue for political and social events - discussions focused on the war or on the traditional family values Putin has championed - becoming a public forum where the ideology he espouses is promoted. Housed for the last eight months in a Soviet-era Moscow park built under Josef Stalin to showcase the USSR's achievements, it has been used by the Kremlin to stoke a feel-good sentiment as Russia is prosecutes what it calls a \"special military operation\" in Ukraine. \"I feel immense pride,\" a visitor called Margarita told Reuters. \"We (Russians) are envied for our unity, for the friendship of all our peoples, for the way we help each other. I don't have the words to express all my feelings and emotions of what I have seen and heard here.\" PERMANENT FIXTURE At Putin's behest, the exhibition - which also appears designed to persuade Russians that their country can keep developing on the home front while being at war - will be moved across the city and become a permanent museum in a complex that was previously used to host major commercial exhibitions. The sprawling installation has a soft side too, showcasing traditional Russian folk culture and cooking along with vital economic statistics and homegrown high-tech. A popular draw for school groups and heavily promoted to families, people from across Russia have travelled to the capital to take it in at a time when the authorities have told Russians they should take inspiration from what they cast as the brightest moments in their country's history to prevail in an \"existential\" struggle with the West. A presentation stand for Crimea, the Black Sea region which Russia seized and annexed from Ukraine in 2014, gives visitors the chance to have their photograph taken with glossy images of the peninsula's landmarks. It shows a sun-kissed map, declaring: \"Crimea. Here is where the motherland starts.\" The four Ukrainian regions the Kremlin says it annexed in 2022, what it calls Russia's \"new regions\" - Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia - are all given similar treatment, despite the fact that Moscow does not control any of them fully. Kyiv's political leadership says it will fight until its forces regain control of all four regions which it says were stolen from it in a brutal colonial-style war of conquest. The Moscow exhibition shows Russia is unlikely to give them back easily. Holding his small son in his arms, Andrei, a visitor from Donetsk, said he felt pride for what he was seeing and was wowed by how Russia's vast expanse, including the \"new regions\", was represented. \"I am originally from Donetsk and very happy that the new regions are fully presented,\" he said.

        "text": "When India's prime minister arrived in Moscow on Tuesday, he greeted Russia's famously chilly president, Vladimir Putin, with an exuberant bear hug.It was a move likely to rile the US, India's most important geopolitical ally, which has placed pressure on New Delhi to loosen its ties with Russia over Putin's invasion of Ukraine.But Prime Minister Narendra Modi's fear of China \u2014 a key Russian ally \u2014 means that he's willing to risk American anger to keep Putin close.\"New Delhi sees Moscow as an important buffer in their relationship due to Moscow's strong ties with Beijing,\" Sarang Shidore, an analyst at the Quincy Institute, told Business Insider.\"It is not in Russia's interest to have China and India at loggerheads, so it could, to a degree, act as a restraining agent.\"During the Cold War, the Soviet Union was among India's most important allies, with the Kremlin providing military support during India's clashes with Pakistan.They've remained close ever since, but the relationship is being tested anew in the fallout from the Ukraine war.The US has attempted to persuade India to take part in its campaign to isolate Russia over the Ukraine invasion \u2014 but with little success.\"Russia is one of India's oldest strategic partners, and New Delhi wants to maintain this relationship regardless of Russia's diplomatic isolation following the war in Ukraine,\" Rahul Bhatia, an analyst at the Eurasia Group, told BI.India has increased its purchase of Russian goods, including oil and fertilizer, at reduced prices after the US imposed sanctions on Russia.It continues to buy Russian armaments, with around 70% of its weapons systems believed to be Russian-made, and its military reliant on the Kremlin for spare parts and upgrades.\"Taking a hardline position against Russia could have both economic and security ramifications for India,\" said Richard Rossow, an analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.The threat from Chinese leader Xi Jinping is another key factor in Modi's determination to ignore US pressure and retain good ties with Putin.China's regional might is growing, and it's menacing India, Asia's other major economic power.In 2020, a long-simmering border dispute resulted in deadly clashes between Indian and Chinese troops. China has bolstered its presence in the Indian Ocean, and the two are jostling for influence in countries in the region.China has built stronger ties with Russia in the wake of the Ukraine invasion, hoping a Russian victory will damage US power and enhance its own global might. And it's this friendship Modi's seeking to drive a wedge between.\"There is a real chance of future conflicts, and India would prefer to avoid Russia exporting advanced military hardware to China,\" said Rossow.Some Indian analysts believe that China poses a greater threat to Russia than NATO in the long term and that India can exploit those differences.\"The Russia-China 'alliance' may be short-term in nature, and that historical conflicts between the two, such as over their long border and under-developed natural resources in Russia's east, will resurface and trigger renewed tensions,\" said Morrow.But for the time being, Russia's new \"no limits\" partnership has got Modi worried, and he'll likely be hoping for a swift end to the Ukraine war. By maintaining good relations with Putin he's hoping he can contain the fallout.\"The war does not at all benefit its interests. The war also opens the door to legitimizing violations of territorial integrity, and endangers a principle that New Delhi has backed strongly,\" said Shidore.",

Roberts, 63, and Laign, 48, first met on a blind date over drinks in 2005 and tied the knot in September 2023. The couple have mainly kept their relationship private, but on the July 9 episode of The Jamie Kern Lima Show, Roberts spoke about how she planned to break up with Laign a year into their relationship because \u201cthere [was] no drama.\u201d \u201cI have never talked about this before, but I'm going to talk about this with you,\" the Good Morning America anchor told Lima, the founder of IT Cosmetics and author of the bestselling book Worthy. \"I\u2019d had dysfunctional relationships that I didn\u2019t know were dysfunctional at the time,\u201d Roberts said. \u201c[Amber] had already told me, \u2018I\u2019m not going to do one of those make up, break up things,\u2019 so it\u2019s about a year in\u2026 and [at that point] in my mind I was like, \u2018I\u2019m out of here,' because there's no drama.\" \"I\u2019m used to conflict and I was equating conflict with love,\u201d Roberts continued. \u201cIf [the relationship] was easygoing, then it must not be sexy, it must not be fun. The relationship was really good but this was my thinking.\u201d Roberts recalled sitting at the bar with Laign and thinking, \"Boy, this is gonna devastate her.\" But as she started her break up speech, Laign told her, \u201cRobin I know the relationship you had before. If that is what you want, knock yourself out.\u201d \u201cI was stunned,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cI thought she would be like \u2018You must stay with me\u2019 and she did just the opposite with such confidence [and said], \u2018I know what you had and I know what you have now and if that\u2019s what you want\u2026\u2019 and I didn\u2019t go through with it.\u201d Never miss a story \u2014 sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories. Roberts said she was \u201cso grateful\u201d to Laign because it made her rethink \u2014 and \"unlearn\" \u2014 what she knew about relationships. \"Why did I think that was love before? Why do I think now that it\u2019s no drama and it's easy\u2026 why do we look at that as not being sexy or not being a true relationship?\" \u201cWe never talk about unlearning, we always talk about learning,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cSometimes you have to unlearn and I had to. I shared this with friends in a similar situation and they were like, \u2018Wow thank you.\u2019\u201d \u201cYou have to really dig deep and go, \u2018Is that what we think is love?\u2019 No,\u2019 but at the time we do.\u201d In January 2023, Roberts announced on Good Morning America that she planned to marry Laign that year. \"I'm hesitating because I haven't said it out loud yet \u2026 I'm saying 'yes' to marriage,\" Roberts said when discussing New Year's intentions on air. \"We're getting married this year.\" The two said \"I do\" in Farmington, Connecticut on Sept. 8, 2023 in front of 250 guests, then celebrated their nuptials a second time in New Orleans in December.

        "text": "Elizabeth Taylor hurt her hip. And Sharon Stone\u2018s life would never be the same. It was May 1995, and the Basic Instinct star, then 37, was at the Cannes Film Festival plugging her new movie, The Quick and the Dead, when she was approached by Dr. Mathilde Krim, founder of the American Foundation for AIDS Research. Would Stone consider standing in for the ailing Taylor as host of the charity\u2019s star-studded annual fundraiser on the Riviera? She said yes, as she had for years for any ask amfAR had of her. But years earlier, it was not an easy decision. In the late \u201980s, AIDS was a disease still shrouded in stigma and shame, even as it devastated much of the artistic community. Stone was warned that taking the gig might very well \u201cruin her career.\u201d She took it anyway and ultimately became Taylor\u2019s successor, serving as amfAR\u2019s celebrity spokesperson for the next two decades. In many ways, she was perfect for the job. Like Taylor, she was bold, glamorous and bursting with star power, exactly the sort of larger-than-life figure who could draw a crowd to a cause that desperately needed attention. Of course, over that same quarter century, Stone\u2019s fortunes in Hollywood have followed more twists and turns than a Joe Eszterhas script \u2014 a stroke in 2001 knocked her off the screen for a full seven years \u2014 but still, even today she\u2019s pretty great at drawing a crowd (albeit sometimes an angry one). Ahead of her keynote speech at THR\u2018s joint summit with the Social Impact Fund, we sat down with the 66-year-old cinematic icon for a frank and freewheeling discussion \u2014 her favorite kind \u2014 not just about her philanthropic endeavors but also about Hollywood\u2019s lingering misogyny problem, her preferred way to be kissed and why she believes it\u2019s time the industry finally forgives Kevin Spacey. So, who told you that becoming amfAR\u2019s spokesperson would ruin your career? My publicist at the time, Cindi Berger. We were thick as thieves back then. We were in Cannes and Dr. Krim and her team approached us. Cindi and I talked about it. We were on this little side street in Cannes, in the dark, and she said, \u201cIf you do this, it\u2019s going to ruin your career.\u201d And I said, \u201cI know.\u201d And she said, \u201cBut if you don\u2019t, I don\u2019t think I could ever talk to you again.\u201d Other celebrities were attaching their names to causes even back then, no? Elizabeth did, and prior to her there was Audrey Hepburn for the United Nations. But big stars [still looking to get hired for big roles] weren\u2019t doing anything for any underrepresented groups, especially a group that was stigmatized. I remember Cindi getting hives all over her neck when we talked about it in Cannes. That stigma has lessened a lot over the years. Now, AIDS medications are being sold in TV commercials. Like aspirin. So, what were the consequences back then? Did it indeed ruin your career? I didn\u2019t get roles. I couldn\u2019t get a job. People would turn me down without me even knowing it. I was up for this beautiful movie by this writer \u2014 I won\u2019t say who it was \u2014 and I never even got the script. To this day, he doesn\u2019t believe that I didn\u2019t read his script. Well, the next year, in 1996, you won a Golden Globe and got nominated for an Oscar for Casino \u2026 But I was never going to win an Oscar. Not ever. Francis Ford Coppola came to me when I was nominated and said, \u201cYou\u2019re not going to win.\u201d He was like, \u201cI want you to be prepared. I don\u2019t want you to fall apart in front of these people.\u201d You left amfAR in 2015. How come? I had a close relationship with Dr. Krim, but then she passed away and I still had to deal with Harvey Weinstein, who was involved with amfAR for 10 years. He did not sexually abuse me, but he was physically abusive. Like, he would throw me across the room, he would grab me. When I\u2019d do the amfAR auction, he would come on the stage and put his hand around my neck, then grab the microphone and try to change the bids. Dealing with him took a tremendous amount of patience from me. You\u2019ve had a lot of experience dealing with misogynists in Hollywood. Well, Hollywood is set up to be misogynistic. It\u2019s a business run by men. It\u2019s a business where men make the money. Where men write, produce and direct the projects. Where men write the parts that are played by women. And those parts are not written about real women. They\u2019re written to be the fantasy of how women should be. Then, the male critics tell you if you met the fantasy or not, if you behaved in the right way. You know, until Basic Instinct, women had to cross their legs a certain way on the screen, at the ankles. You couldn\u2019t cross your legs like a man. You weren\u2019t even allowed to show your armpits. We had to get permission for me to show my armpits in that movie. Wait a second. Paul Verhoeven infamously snuck in a shot of your bare crotch in Basic Instinct \u2014 that was OK for him to do? But he needed permission to show your armpits? That [crotch] shot wasn\u2019t even a full frame. It was only a third of one frame. It\u2019s called a squeeze frame. But the scene with the armpits, we had to deal with that. Your character in that movie \u2014 Catherine Tramell \u2014 is controversial to this day. Some critics say she\u2019s an anti-feminist monster, others hail her as a powerful icon of empowered womanhood. Which is she? I guess it depends on if she scares you or not. I would say MAGA people would probably think she\u2019s scary. And you? What did you think of her? I wanted to play her so badly that I had the script on top of my refrigerator for eight months. I just kept thinking, \u201cI\u2019m going to manifest this, I\u2019m going to get this part,\u201d as they offered it to everybody else on the planet \u2026 Yeah, many actresses turned it down \u2026 I was the 13th choice. The line producer told me that relentlessly though the entire shoot while he called me Karen. \u201cYou, Karen, were the 13th choice.\u201d And then the movie comes out and suddenly you\u2019re one of the biggest stars in the world. Which I didn\u2019t really get for quite a while, because when I did Total Recall, I had fame for like three months. But with Basic Instinct, four months went by, five months, six, and the fame wasn\u2019t going away. How did that make you feel? Did you like being famous? Yes! It felt like a relief. It was so crazy. As I walked down the carpet in Cannes and a thousand people started chanting my name, I had such a surge of relief come over me, such a feeling of calm. Relief from what? When I was little, growing up in Meadville, Pennsylvania, I had this feeling that I was going to be a movie star. This is who I was going to be. I was going to live in a house that had a spiral staircase. It was weird because I was super shy. When I read from the Bible in church, I was so shy my tears would drop on the Bible pages. I was the sort of kid who sat in my closet with a flashlight and read. But I just knew I was going to be a star. So, when it happened, I just suddenly felt like I was in my body. You grew up relatively poor, no? My dad made $14,000 a year and had four kids, and we were considered wealthy in our community because I had school shoes and play shoes. I grew up in a place with no stoplights. There were 87 people in my class. Kids drove their tractors to school after they did their chores. But you know what, I just found out that I\u2019m French royalty. I just did that show on PBS, Finding Your Roots, and it turns out I\u2019m related to Charlemagne. I am from a long line of royalty in France. We were talking about misogyny in Hollywood. Do you think the environment has improved at all? Has the #MeToo movement made any difference? I think men are men and women are women. And I think that\u2019s something we should want. I think we should want men to flirt with us. Now, these days, there are some women who don\u2019t like certain things that I still like. For instance, I don\u2019t want a man to ask me if he can kiss me, I really don\u2019t. I want him to just grab me and kiss me \u2026 But only if it\u2019s the right man, I presume. You obviously want to be able to say no. Yes, if I don\u2019t want it, I want to say, \u201cNo, thank you,\u201d and for it to stop. But if he\u2019s the right man and he throws me against the wall and kisses me \u2014 yes, please, to that. I really miss passion. I really miss sexual expression. I find this whole thing very stifling. Also, we really need to delineate between what\u2019s a misdemeanor and what\u2019s a felony. That needs to happen. There\u2019s a difference between a slap on the ass and rape. They aren\u2019t the same thing. You got into a little hot water recently for defending Kevin Spacey. People are mad at me for that. I said that after being in therapy for seven years, not being allowed to work, losing his home, losing everything, he should be allowed to come back. He\u2019s reached out to everybody he\u2019s offended and said he\u2019s sorry. Kevin grabbed people by their genitals. Many people. But nobody [has publicly said] he\u2019s raped them or forced them into a sexual encounter. But there\u2019s so much hatred for him because in his case it was man-on-man. That\u2019s why he\u2019s not allowed to come back. Because he offended men. But can I tell you how many men have grabbed my genitals in my lifetime? A lot more than Kevin Spacey has grabbed men\u2019s genitals. And none of them has ever apologized to me. Do you think you\u2019re more forgiving of canceled people because you\u2019ve so often teetered on the edge of cancellation yourself? Oh, I\u2019ve been canceled left and right. But now I\u2019m back in fashion again. All the things that I said and did in the \u201990s that were so outrageous are now in fashion. Here\u2019s the thing \u2014 I\u2019m a dark horse. I love dark horses. I don\u2019t want to be a white horse or wear a white hat. And I get that not everybody thinks I\u2019m a good person. I get that people think I\u2019m difficult. But I\u2019m the person who wants to make sure you have water to drink and wants to make sure you have books to read and somewhere to read them. Can we talk about your stroke in 2001? You were given a 1 percent chance of survival. You lost hearing in one ear. You had 23 platinum coils surgically implanted in your brain. In the middle of it all, there was the divorce from your husband at the time, Phil Bronstein \u2026 That was the good part. That was the upside. Did the stroke change the way your brain worked? Did it change how you think? Totally. One hundred percent. A Buddhist monk told me that I had been reincarnated into my same body. I had a death experience and then they brought me back. I bled into my brain for nine days, so my brain was shoved to the front of my face. It wasn\u2019t positioned in my head where it was before. And while that was happening, everything changed. My sense of smell, my sight, my touch. I couldn\u2019t read for a couple of years. Things were stretched and I was seeing color patterns. A lot of people thought I was going to die. And it took you seven years to fully recover, right? Yes, and people took advantage of me over that time. I had $18 million saved because of all my success, but when I got back into my bank account, it was all gone. My refrigerator, my phone \u2014 everything was in other people\u2019s names. You were left completely broke? I had zero money. How do you recover from that? I decided to stay present and let go. I decided not to hang onto being sick or to any bitterness or anger. If you bite into the seed of bitterness, it never leaves you. But if you hold faith, even if that faith is the size of a mustard seed, you will survive. So, I live for joy now. I live for purpose.

        "text": "Tie those togas, lace up those sandals, and get in the chariot, loser \u2014 we're going back to the arena. The first trailer for Ridley Scott's long-awaited sequel Gladiator II is providing fans the first battle-heavy glimpse at what's in store in the historical epic, which takes place in the 20-plus years since the events of the Russell Crowe-led 2000 original. It introduces Paul Mescal's grown-up Lucius, nephew of the late Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix) and the son of Lucilla (once again played by Connie Nielsen). After the events of the first film, he was sent by his mother to live on the northern coast of Africa to shield him from the corruption and violence of Rome. He grew up there, but as an adult, he finds himself thrust back into Roman life \u2014 and the arena \u2014 when forces led by General Marcus Acacius (Pedro Pascal) invade his home in Numidia and eventually take him captive. The trailer also introduces Denzel Washington's Macrinus, a very wealthy arms dealer who uses gladiators for sport, as well as the film's two main antagonists: megalomaniacal twin emperors Caracalla (Fred Hechinger) and Geta (Joseph Quinn). Legacy cast member Derek Jacobi is also reprising his role as Gracchus. May Calamawy (Moon Knight, Ramy), Lior Raz (Operation Finale), Peter Mensah (Avatar), Matt Lucas (Wonka, Bridesmaids), and more round out the cast. Scott returns once more as director, and several other artists who brought the original Gladiator to life are returning to his sequel, as well. This includes cinematographer John Mathieson, production designer Arthur Max, and costume designer Janty Yates. All the Money in the World and Napoleon scribe David Scarpa penned the screenplay, with a story by Scarpa and Peter Craig. Want more movie news?

        "text": "Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi met President Vladimir Putin in Moscow on Tuesday, seeking to deepen the relationship between the two nuclear powers at a time when NATO leaders gathered in Washington and Russia launched deadly missile attacks in Ukraine that hit a children\u2019s hospital. \u201cOur relationship is one of a particularly privileged strategic partnership,\u201d Putin told Modi, who made his first trip to Russia since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine by the Kremlin\u2019s forces in 2022. Modi has avoided condemning Russia while emphasizing a peaceful settlement. Their partnership has become more complicated, however, as Russia has moved closer to China amid international isolation of Moscow over Ukraine. Modi did not attend last week\u2019s summit in Kazakhstan of a security organization founded by Moscow and Beijing. Modi arrived in Moscow on Monday, shortly after Russian missiles struck across Ukraine, severely damaging the largest children\u2019s hospital in Kyiv and killing at least 42 people nationwide, including some children, officials said. Modi on Tuesday alluded to the bloodshed while speaking about his meeting with Putin, which included over four hours of talks. \u201cBe it war, a struggle or a terrorist attack, every person who believes in humanity, when there is loss of life, he is pained,\u201d the Indian prime minister said. \u201cWhen innocent children are killed, when we see innocent children dying, then the heart pains. And that pain is very horrible.\u201d Modi said the two leaders shared \u201cour opinions on Ukraine with an open heart and in detail. We respectfully listened to each other.\u201d Modi added that \u201ca solution is not possible on the battlefield. Between bombs, guns and bullets, a solution and peace talks cannot be successful. And we have to adopt the path of peace only through talks.\u201d Modi\u2019s trip received extensive coverage at home, including his laying a wreath at the tomb of the unknown soldier at the Kremlin wall. But coverage of Russia\u2019s deadly attack Monday in Ukraine was muted. In televised comments, Putin said \u201call issues\u201d were discussed with Modi, who visited the Russian leader at his residence near Moscow on Monday. The two shook hands and embraced as they met. At the NATO summit in Washington, Western leaders marked the military alliance\u2019s 75th anniversary and sought to reassure Ukraine of their support. While Western countries have hit Russia with sanctions, Putin pointed out that trade between Russia and India increased by 66% last year, adding that it\u2019s a key focus of Modi\u2019s trip. Modi said that because of Russia\u2019s support, \u201cwe were able to save Indian citizens from difficulties related to requirements of petrol and diesel,\u201d adding that the nations\u2019 agreements on energy \u201chelped provide market stability to the world indirectly.\u201d Russian state media reported that they would also discuss Moscow helping India build more nuclear power plants. The two countries already are collaborating on the Kudankulam nuclear power project in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu. Russia had strong ties with India during the Cold War, and New Delhi\u2019s importance as a key trading partner with Moscow has grown since the war in Ukraine. China and India are key buyers of Russian oil following sanctions imposed by the United States and its allies that shut most Western markets off to Russian exports. India now gets more than 40% of its oil imports from Russia, according to analysts. Modi last traveled to Russia in 2019, when he attended a forum in the far eastern port of Vladivostok and met with Putin. They also saw each other in September 2022 in Uzbekistan, at a summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization bloc. A confrontation in June 2020 along the disputed China-India border dramatically altered the already touchy relationship between Beijing and New Delhi as rival troops fought with rocks, clubs and fists. At least 20 Indian soldiers and four Chinese soldiers were killed. Tensions have persisted \u2014 and have seeped into how India views Russia. But Modi is expected to continue close relations with Russia, which is also a major defense supplier for India. With Moscow\u2019s arms industries mostly serving the Russian military in Ukraine, India has been diversifying its defense procurements, buying more from the U.S., Israel, France and Italy. Trade development also is important, particularly intentions to develop a maritime corridor between India\u2019s major port of Chennai and Vladivostok, the gateway to Russia\u2019s Far East. India-Russia trade has seen a sharp increase, touching close to $65 billion in the 2023-24 financial year, due to strong energy cooperation, Indian Foreign Secretary Vinay Mohan Kwatra said Friday. Russian imports touched $60 billion and exports from India $4 billion in the 2023-24 financial year. India\u2019s financial year runs from April to March. \u2014- Burrows reported from London and Pathi from New Delhi.",

        "text": "Rescue operations stretched into a second day at a major Kyiv children\u2019s hospital struck by a Russian missile, Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Tuesday, as officials raised the countrywide casualty toll to 42 dead and almost 200 injured in the previous day's intense daytime barrage that smashed into multiple cities. Zelenskyy said on the social platform X that 64 people were hospitalized in the capital, as well as 28 in Kryvyi Rih and six in Dnipro \u2014 both cities in central Ukraine. It was Russia\u2019s heaviest bombardment of Kyiv in almost four months and one of the deadliest of the war, hitting seven of the city\u2019s 10 districts. The strike on the Okhmatdyt children\u2019s hospital, which interrupted open-heart surgery and forced young cancer patients to take their treatments outdoors, drew an international outcry. RUSSIAN MISSILES HIT CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL IN KYIV AS UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT ZELENSKYY VOWS RETALIATION The 10-story hospital, which is Ukraine's largest medical facility for children, was caring for some 670 patients at the time of the attack, Okhmatdyt\u2019s Director General, Volodymyr Zhovnir, said Tuesday. The missile hit a two-story wing of the hospital. \"The building where we conducted dialysis for children with kidney failure or acute intoxication is ruined entirely,\" he told reporters, estimating the overall damage to the hospital at $2.5 million. Danielle Bell, the head of a U.N. team tracking human rights violations in Ukraine, said at least two people were killed at the hospital and some 50 people were injured, including seven children. The casualty figure would have been much higher if patients hadn't been taken to a bunker when air raid sirens first sounded, she added. Authorities were working to restore the hospital's power and water supply, Zhovnir said. Kyiv city administrators declared Tuesday an official day of mourning. Entertainment events were prohibited and flags were lowered in the capital. Russia denied responsibility for the hospital strike, insisting it doesn\u2019t attack civilian targets in Ukraine despite abundant evidence to the contrary, including Associated Press reporting. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov on Tuesday repeated that position, pointing to a Russian Defense Ministry statement that blamed a Ukrainian air defense missile for partially destroying the hospital. Bell, the head of the U.N. team, dismissed that argument. She said an assessment of video footage and findings on site indicated the hospital \"took a direct hit, rather than receiving damage due to an intercepted weapons system.\" The hospital likely was struck by a Russian Kh-101 cruise missile, Bell said. Ukrainian officials said the same. The bodies of three more people were found Tuesday under the rubble of a residential building in the Shevchenkivskyi district of Kyiv, officials said, bringing the death toll in the single building to 10. The Russian onslaught Monday came on the eve of a NATO summit in Washington where alliance countries are expected to pledge new military and economic support for Ukraine. Russian President Vladimir Putin, meanwhile, was hosting India\u2019s Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Moscow. New Delhi\u2019s importance as a key trading partner has grown since the Kremlin sent troops into Ukraine in February 2022. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Zelenskyy was deeply critical of Modi\u2019s visit, saying on X late Monday: \"It is a huge disappointment and a devastating blow to peace efforts to see the leader of the world\u2019s largest democracy hug the world\u2019s most bloody criminal in Moscow on such a day.\" Meanwhile, Russian military and regional officials said Tuesday that Ukrainian drones targeted six Russian regions overnight, in what appeared to be a bigger-than-usual aerial attack by Kyiv's forces. Russia\u2019s Defense Ministry said air defense systems in five Russian southern and western regions \"destroyed and intercepted\" a total of 38 Ukrainian drones.",

        "text": "Russia will discharge all Indians who are fighting for Moscow's forces in Ukraine following a deal between Vladimir Putin and Narendra Modi, it has been reported.India's prime minister arrived in Moscow Monday for a two-day visit\u2014his first to Russia in three years, with trade between the countries booming since the start of Putin's full-scale invasion.Indian media outlet NDTV said the leaders discussed the fate of dozens of Indian troops who claimed they were tricked into taking up a fighting role after being persuaded by agents to go to Russia on the pretext of getting high-paying jobs. Two Indian men have reportedly died in the war in Ukraine.A video went viral in March of men from the Punjab and Haryana regions wearing army uniforms in Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia Oblast and asking for help after claiming they had been tricked into fighting.NDTV said the men had gone to Russia on December 27 to celebrate the new year there. One of the men said an agent in Russia had offered to take them to Belarus, not knowing they needed a visa.When they got there, they were abandoned by the agent and picked up by the police, before being handed over to the authorities and made to sign documents \"forcing\" them to fight in the war against Ukraine, the Indian outlet reported.But NDTV said that Modi raised the issue at a private dinner hosted by Putin on Monday, according to unnamed sources, during which Moscow agreed to discharge all Indians serving in their army and facilitate their return.The outlet also reported that Indian law enforcement had carried out raids and busted a ring involved in trafficking Indians to Russia.When asked about the reported deal between the leaders, Putin's spokesman replied, \"we do not comment on this topic in any way,\" state news agency Interfax reported. Newsweek has contacted the Kremlin and the Indian foreign ministry for further comment.Refraining from imposing sanctions for Putin's aggression, India has capitalized on its \"friendly\" country status with Russia and is now only behind China in its purchases of Russian oil. Trade in other products has also increased with trade last year worth a record $65.7 billion according to India's Trade Ministry.Putin and Modi are starting new terms in office, with the Russian leader reelected for a fifth term as president in disputed elections in March. Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) won elections last month albeit with a lesser majority than predicted.Modi broke with the tradition of newly-elected Indian leaders visiting neighboring countries first, and chose Russia instead, leading analysts to conclude it was due to New Delhi's concern at Moscow's increasing dependence on Beijing.",

        "text": "WASHINGTON -- Leaders of NATO countries will open their annual summit on July 9 in Washington to discuss ways to bolster the alliance's defense capabilities and support Ukraine against the backdrop of political uncertainty in the host country and Russia's intense bombing of Ukraine. NATO is expected to announce plans for European members to boost spending on weapons and ammunition procurement following years of underinvestment as well as a 40 billion-euro ($43 billion) aid package for Ukraine. The agenda of the three-day summit, which will mark NATO's 75th anniversary, will be partially overshadowed by concerns about U.S. President Joe Biden's age and ability to lead after his chances of winning reelection this November took a hit following his dismal debate performance against Republican contender Donald Trump last month. Support and aid to Ukraine is likely to take on even greater immediacy at the summit following one of the worst Russian air attacks on the country since the Kremlin launched the full-scale invasion in February 2022. The barrage of missiles fired across Ukraine on July 8 struck several civilian facilities, including Kyiv's Okhmatdyt Children's Hospital, killing at least 41 people in total and injuring scores more in what Biden called a \"horrific reminder of Russia's brutality.\" Michael Carpenter, senior director for NATO at the National Security Council, told reporters on July 8 that the allies will announce new measures to bolster Ukraine's security, including air defense and F-16 fighter jets, but he did not give any details. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has for months pleaded with NATO members for more air defense, especially the U.S.-made Patriot missile system, to defend its troops, cities, and infrastructure against large-scale Russian bombing campaigns. The alliance will also announce a new NATO military command in Germany to coordinate the training and equipping of Ukrainian troops and station a senior NATO representative in Kyiv. However, the summit will not extend an invitation for Ukraine to join the alliance. Carpenter said there was still no consensus on the issue among the 32 allies. The NATO communique is expected to say that Ukraine belongs in the alliance without giving a time frame for when it will join. NATO members also couldn't agree on a multiyear military aid package for Ukraine that outgoing Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg had proposed. Instead, NATO will announce a one-year, 40 billion-euro package. Biden and Zelenskiy will meet on July 11 and be joined by the leaders of about two dozen other countries that have signed bilateral security agreements with Ukraine. Biden last month signed a 10-year agreement that calls on the United States, among other things, to help bolster Ukraine's military-industrial complex through co-production and joint ventures with U.S. industry. The expected announcements have disappointed some Western supporters of Ukraine who want greater aid and a clearer path into NATO. \"I don't see this summit doing much for Ukraine at all,\" Kurt Volker, who served as U.S. ambassador to NATO in 2008-09 and former special envoy to Ukraine in 2017-19, told the Center for a New American Security earlier this month. But Carpenter said the commitments made to Ukraine during the summit will show that Russian President Vladimir Putin's strategy of outlasting the alliance won't work. NATO unity on Ukraine, however, will be challenged at the summit by Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, whose pro-Russian views have irked the alliance. Orban, who just took over the rotating presidency of the EU, flew to Moscow last week without informing the bloc ahead of time to discuss an end to the war with Putin. The trip was denounced by Zelenskiy, the EU, and the Biden administration. NATO Spending Defense spending by NATO members will be another hot topic at the summit. NATO members committed a decade ago to reach a defense spending target of at least 2 percent of gross national product by 2024. Stoltenberg said that 23 of the alliance's 32 members will meet that target this year. \"One of the things you'll see at the summit, certainly behind closed doors, is that there'll be a lot of allies holding each other's feet to the fire in terms of defense spending commitments,\" Carpenter said. U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson (Republican-Louisiana), a Trump ally, said on July 8 that Republicans \"celebrate the peace and stability that NATO has secured...but we also believe that NATO needs to be doing more.\" \u201cEveryone cannot ride along on the coattails of America. And Donald Trump says this as bluntly as anyone. It\u2019s just right and fair for us to demand that others do their part,\u201d he said. The United States accounts for 68 percent of NATO defense spending. Some Western officials say 2 percent should be a floor, not a ceiling, and that NATO members should be spending 2.5 percent or more amid growing threats from Russia, China, and Iran. \"If we look into the future, and we look into fully resourcing our defense plans and preparing for all possible contingency, this will require for a number of countries to go beyond 2 percent,\" Benedetta Berti, head of policy planning in the office of the NATO secretary-general. Johnson, who spoke at the Hudson Institute, a Washington think tank, said Republicans were pushing for a \"self-reliant European defense industrial base.\" Trump harangued NATO allies when he was president for not meeting their spending commitments, threatening at one point to withdraw the United States from the alliance. Biden's poor debate performance and the specter of another Trump presidency has many European allies worried. But National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said the White House had not picked up any signed from allies that they need to \"be reassured of American leadership and President Biden's commitments.\" Strengthening ties with Asian partners to contain China will be another topic at the summit. NATO allies will be joined by the leaders of four Asian countries, including Japan, South Korea, Australia, and New Zealand. NATO members have criticized China for supplying Russia with electronics used in weapons production. \"The global threats and challenges we face, including from authoritarian actors and terrorist organizations, are all inextricably linked,\" Carpenter said. For Stoltenberg, the summit is expected to be his last major event before he departs the alliance on October 1. He will be replaced by Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte.

        "text": "Many medical students attending Johns Hopkins will be able to receive free tuition thanks to the university receiving a $1 billion financial gift from Bloomberg. On Monday, July 8, Johns Hopkins University announced that Bloomberg Philanthropies had gifted them a hefty donation of $1 billion, something they called a \"transformative\" investment. The university's news release came after the announcement was officially made in a letter from Bloomberg founder and Johns Hopkins 1964 alum, Michael Bloomberg. The sum will ensure free tuition for medical students who are from families earning less than $300,000. In addition to free tuition, students from families earning less than $175,000 will also have their living expenses covered. \u201cBloomberg Philanthropies today announced a new $1 billion gift to make medical school free at Johns Hopkins University for a majority of students, while also increasing financial aid for students at its schools of nursing, public health, and other graduate schools,\u201d the statement from Bloomberg Philanthropies read. \u201cThe high cost of medical and nursing school has kept many talented lower-income students from enrolling, graduating, or working in the fields and communities most in need.\u201d The PEOPLE Puzzler crossword is here! How quickly can you solve it? Play now! Bloomberg Philanthropies revealed that almost \u201ctwo-thirds of all students seeking an M.D. from Johns Hopkins qualify for financial aid,\u201d adding that people graduate from the university with an average student loan debt of around $104,000. Financial aid will come into practice for students this fall and is expected to bring Johns Hopkins\u2019 medical students\u2019 average student loan debt to $60,279 by 2029, while students from most American families won\u2019t pay anything at all, per the press release from Bloomberg Philanthropies.

In 2018, the organization donated $1.8 billion to Johns Hopkins to provide financial aid to undergraduate students at 82-year-old Bloomberg\u2019s alma mater, per a press release from the university.",

        "text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 In the third year of the war in Ukraine, NATO is set to deepen relations with its four Indo-Pacific partners, which, although not part of the military alliance, are gaining prominence as Russia and China forge closer ties to counter the United States and the two Koreas support opposing sides of the conflict in Europe. The leaders of New Zealand, Japan and South Korea for the third year in a row will attend the NATO summit, which starts Tuesday in Washington, D.C., while Australia will send its deputy prime minister. China will be following the summit closely, worried by the alliance's growing interest beyond Europe and the Western Hemisphere. \"Increasingly, partners in Europe see challenges halfway around the world in Asia as being relevant to them, just as partners in Asia see challenges halfway around the world in Europe as being relevant to them,\" Secretary of State Antony Blinken said last week at the Brookings Institution. America's top diplomat said the U.S. has been working to break down barriers between European alliances, Asian coalitions and other partners worldwide. \u201cThat\u2019s part of the new landscape, the new geometry that we\u2019ve put in place.\u201d Countries with shared security concerns are strengthening ties as competition escalates between the United States and China. Washington is trying to curb Beijing's ambition to challenge the U.S.-led world order, which the Chinese government dismisses as a Cold War mentality aimed at containing China's inevitable rise. On Monday, Beijing responded angrily to unconfirmed reports that NATO and its four Indo-Pacific partners are expected to release a document laying out their relationship and ability to respond jointly to threats from cyberattacks and disinformation. Lin Jian, a spokesman for the Chinese foreign ministry, accused NATO of \u201cbreaching its boundary, expanding its mandate, reaching beyond its defense zone and stoking confrontation.\u201d The war in Ukraine, which has pitted the West against Russia and its friends, has bolstered the argument for closer cooperation between the U.S., Europe and their Asian allies. \u201cUkraine of today may be East Asia of tomorrow,\u201d Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida told the U.S. Congress in April. The U.S. and South Korea accused Pyongyang of supplying Russia with ammunition, while Russian President Vladimir Putin visited North Korea last month and signed a pact with leader Kim Jong Un that envisions mutual military assistance. South Korea and Japan, meanwhile, are sending military supplies and aid to Ukraine. The U.S. also says China is providing Russia with machine tools, microelectronics and other technology that allow it to make weapons to use against Ukraine. South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol will bring to Washington \u201ca strong message regarding the military cooperation between Russia and North Korea and discuss ways to enhance cooperation among NATO allies and Indo-Pacific partners,\u201d his principal deputy national security adviser, Kim Tae-hyo, told reporters Friday. New Zealand Prime Minister Christopher Luxon said discussions would \u201cfocus on our collective efforts to support the rules-based system.\u201d The partnership does not make NATO a direct player in the Indo-Pacific but allows it to coordinate with the four partners on issues of mutual concern, said Mirna Galic, senior policy analyst on China and East Asia at the U.S. Institute of Peace. For example, she wrote in an analysis, they can share information and align on actions such as sanctions and aid delivery but do not intervene in military crises outside of their own regions. The NATO summit will allow the United States and its European and Indo-Pacific allies to push back against China, Russia, North Korea and Iran, according to Luis Simon, director of the Centre for Security Diplomacy and Strategy at Vrije Universiteit Brussel. \u201cThe fact that the Euro-Atlantic and Indo-Pacific alliances are structured around a clear anchor \u2014 U.S. military power \u2014 makes them more cohesive and gives them a strategic edge as compared to the sort of interlocking partnerships that bind China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea,\" Simon wrote in a commentary last week on War On the Rocks, a defense and foreign affairs website. Beijing is worried by NATO's pivot to the east, said Zhu Feng, dean of the School of International Studies at Nanjing University in eastern China. Beijing has insisted that NATO not interfere in security affairs in the Indo-Pacific and that it should change its view of China as a strategic adversary. \u201cNATO should consider China as a positive force for the regional peace and stability and for global security,\u201d Zhu said. \u201cWe also hope the Ukraine war can end as soon as possible ... and we have rejected a return to the triangular relation with Russia and North Korea.\u201d \u201cIn today's volatile and fragile world, Europe, the U.S. and China should strengthen global and regional cooperation,\u201d Zhu said. NATO and China had little conflict until tensions grew between Beijing and Washington in 2019, the same year the NATO summit in London raised China as a \u201cchallenge\u201d that \u201cwe need to address together as an alliance.\" Two years later, NATO upgraded China to a \u201csystemic challenge\u201d and said Beijing was \u201ccooperating militarily with Russia.\u201d After Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, leaders of Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand attended a NATO summit for the first time, where statements noted the geopolitical challenges China poses. Beijing accused NATO of \u201ccooperating with the U.S. government for an all-around suppression of China.\" Now, Beijing is worried that Washington is forming a NATO-like alliance in the Indo-Pacific. Chinese Senior Col. Cao Yanzhong, a researcher at China\u2019s Institute of War Studies, asked U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin last month whether the U.S. was trying to create an Asian version of NATO by emphasizing partnerships and alliances. They include a U.S. grouping with Britain and Australia; another with Australia, India and Japan; and one with Japan and South Korea. \u201cWhat implications do you think the strengthening of the U.S. alliance system in the Asia-Pacific will have on this region\u2019s security and stability?\u201d Cao asked at the Shangri-la Dialogue security summit in Singapore. Austin replied that the U.S. was simply working with \u201clike-minded countries with similar values and a common vision of a free and open Indo-Pacific.\" Beijing has its own conclusion. \u201cThe real intent of the U.S. Indo-Pacific strategy is to integrate all small circles into a big circle as the Asian version of NATO in order to maintain the hegemony as led by the United States,\u201d Chinese Lt. Gen. Jing Jianfeng said at the forum. ___ AP researcher Chen Wanqing in Beijing contributed to this report.",

        "text": "\u201cOf all the horrid, hideous notes of woe,\u201d wrote my favorite English poet, Lord Byron, \u201cSadder than owl-songs or the midnight blast; Is that portentous phrase, \u2018I told you so.'\u201d Or, to put those words in the modern-day American vernacular: Nobody likes a smart-ass Monday morning quarterback. But sometimes, the words \u201cI told you so\u201d need to be said to expose those who saw all the same horrid, hideous signs of woe \u2013 but failed to speak up. The US mainstream media is currently gorging on President Biden\u2019s cognitive decline like ravenous hyenas on the freshly slain carcass of a decrepit old buffalo. In fact, since his train-wreck debate debacle, the nation\u2019s predominantly liberal-skewed, Democrat-defending journalists have competed with each other as to who can sound the most faux shocked, horrified, appalled, and furrowed-brow-uncomprehending about the physical and mental state of their President. To which I say, REALLY? THAT Biden was a surprise to you? You all had NO idea the President of the United States is now an incoherent bumbling virtual zombie who shuffles at snail pace and can barely remember what day it is? With all due respect to my esteemed media colleagues, I call bulls\u2013t. They\u2019ve all known the truth about Biden\u2019s fast-deteriorating physical condition and clear early dementia for several years, because he\u2019s been literally showing them the evidence on an almost daily basis. When he\u2019s not been face-planting on stage, tripping on the steps of Air Force One, or falling off his bike, he\u2019s been forgetting names, talking incomprehensible gibberish, spewing blatant easily provable falsehoods, and unleashing an endless outpouring of verbal gaffes, some trivial like repeatedly calling his vice-president \u201cPresident Harris,\u201d others way more serious and potentially dangerous like vowing a US military response if China invades Taiwan. And unlike those who chose to look the other way or deny what they saw and heard with their own eyes and ears \u2013 I have documented them in my weekly New York Post columns. For example, In March 2022, after Biden made a series of crazy statements surrounding Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine that had to be instantly and disingenuously walked back by frantic White House aides \u2013 including one where he said Putin mustn\u2019t be allowed to remain in power, which his people comically insisted didn\u2019t mean he thought Putin shouldn\u2019t stay in power, or regime change in Russia \u2013 I wrote: \u201cJoe Biden is showing increasingly worrying signs of age-related cognitive decline. That\u2019s a big problem for America, and the world, at such a critical time. As is the pathetic way that Democrats and much of the mainstream media keep trying to excuse his dreadful gaffes and talk up his supposedly commanding leadership. They\u2019re so desperate to portray him as the calm, smart, wise, fact-driven antidote to his predecessor Donald Trump that they can\u2019t see the shambolic trainwreck right in front of their eyes. Or they see it but choose to ignore it.\u201d See, I told you so. And that was over two years ago. Things have got increasingly worse since then. In July 2022, while speaking about the Supreme Court\u2019s historic overturning of Roe vs Wade, Biden read out a prompt line from staffers: \u201cEnd of quote, repeat the line.\u201d As I wrote then: \u201cIt may be time to invoke the 25th Amendment on ailing, failing Biden if he deteriorates further.\u201d He even started forgetting people had died. In September 2022, he asked during another speech, \u201cJackie, are you here? Where\u2019s Jackie?\u201d as he searched the room for Jackie Walorski, an Indiana congresswoman who had been killed in a car accident the month before, and about whom he had issued a heartfelt statement of condolence to her family saying how shocked and saddened that he was by her death. In June 2023, two months after he announced he was running again for president, he ended a speech about gun control with the words: \u201cGod save the Queen, man.\u201d But Queen Elizabeth II had passed nine months earlier, and he\u2019d attended her funeral. I wrote then: \u201cPresident Biden is showing more and more signs of deteriorating cognitive and physical decline that isn\u2019t just to do with his age. I know 90-year-olds who are twice as lucid and mobile as he is. No, the cold, hard, brutal reality is that Biden\u2019s losing it, and he\u2019s losing it while also trying to be President of the United States and de facto leader of the free world \u2013 one of the most relentlessly difficult, energy-sapping, and pressurized jobs imaginable.\u2019 That was a year ago, yet still most of the media pretended Joe Biden was still in full charge of his faculties. Nothing to see here, move along, focus on criminal Trump! In September 2023, after a barrage of more cringe-worthy incidents and mishaps, including his claim to have been at Ground Zero the day after 9/11, when he didn\u2019t go there until nine days after, I wrote: \u201cThis guy is still running the world\u2019s No.1 superpower when he looks barely fit, either physically or cognitively, to run a bath. I honestly look at Biden now and genuinely wonder if he knows what day it is, let alone what he\u2019s supposed to be doing. The sad, unnerving reality is that every time President Biden appears in public now, everyone \u2013 including his own White House staff \u2013 holds their breath to see what verbal mistake he\u2019ll make, what vital US policy he might suddenly and dangerously rewrite, what indecipherable word salad he\u2019ll spew, or just whether he can manage to stay on his own two feet.\u201d That was 10 months ago! Since then, he\u2019s persisted in saying his war hero son Beau died serving his country in Iraq when, as everyone knows, he very sadly died from brain cancer in the US and he preposterously claimed his uncle was shot down and possibly eaten by cannibals in Papua New Guinea when there is no evidence for either claim. But to be fair to Biden, it\u2019s hard to know if he was lying or genuinely delusional. In December 2023, he responded to a reporter shouting, \u201cMr President, why are you losing to Trump in the polls?\u201d by saying: \u201cYou\u2019re reading the wrong polls!\u201d One second later, there was a loud bang as a random vehicle smashed accidentally into his presidential motorcade. I wrote: \u201cBiden\u2019s presidency has become a slow-moving car crash. What\u2019s inexplicable is why the Democrats seem so hell-bent on standing by a leader who\u2019s become not just a national but a global joke.\u201d That was six months ago. In January 2024, after he embarrassingly struggled to say \u201cAmerica,\u201d blathering, \u201cDon\u2019t mess with uhhiminauhwemerica,\u201d I wrote: \u201cUltimately, and most damningly, all roads lead back to his advanced age and apparent senility. When you can\u2019t even pronounce the name of the country you\u2019re supposed to be leading, it\u2019s time to go.\u201d And last month, when Barack Obama had to lead him by hand off a stage at a fundraiser in LA, I wrote: \u201cThe Obama/Biden arm-grab wasn\u2019t just a senior moment, it was the moment everyone realized the President\u2019s not fit for office. This is a once very eloquent, fast-talking, firebrand senator who can now barely speak without talking gibberish, nor walk quicker than a snail on Mogadon, and who keeps falling over or forgetting what he\u2019s supposed to be doing or saying.\u201d Then came the debate, and all the supine fawning journalists who\u2019d bent over so far backwards to stop the American people from knowing the truth about their president that I\u2019m only surprised they didn\u2019t all suffer broken vertebrae, suddenly found their eyes, ears and voices. So yes, I told you so. As did others. For years. And for telling the truth, we were branded liars, and scaremongers, and partisan pro-Republican hacks trying to distract from the real story \u2013 Trump. Now those who screamed loudest about Biden being fit and well for office are the same ones screaming the loudest about why he must quit the 2024 race because he\u2019s unwell and unfit for office. This is not because they give a damn about his health or want to finally be honest about it with the American people, but because they\u2019ve belatedly realized that he can\u2019t beat Donald Trump. It\u2019s been a repulsive conspiracy of collusion, and to borrow the prose of Lord Byron, their crocodile tears are \u201chorrid and hideous.\u201d",

        "text": "Tesla's self-driving cars seem like a marvel of machine learning. But in reality, the company relies on a small army of human \"data annotators\" who continuously improve how the cars drive by reviewing camera footage from thousands of Tesla drivers and teaching the vehicle how to behave like a human driver, like deciding when it's appropriate to use a blinker or identifying a construction cone.Business Insider has learned that those annotators focus their efforts on two high-profile categories of drivers: Tesla CEO Elon Musk and a select set of \"VIP\" drivers.BI spoke with over a dozen current and former Tesla employees, all but one who spoke on condition of anonymity, who said images and video clips from Musk's Teslas received meticulous scrutiny, while data from high-profile drivers like YouTubers received \"VIP\" treatment in identifying and addressing issues with the Full Self-Driving software. The result is that Tesla's Autopilot and FSD software may better navigate routes taken by Musk and other high-profile drivers, making their rides smoother and more straightforward.That means, experts say, Tesla's resources are being unevenly distributed and could serve as a distraction toward the company's larger mission of truly autonomous driving.Each Tesla is equipped with nine cameras, and owners can opt to share video from those cameras to improve Tesla's systems.Tesla's legion of data annotators review the clips shared with Tesla and use the images to train the system to execute a proper left turn or identify a stop sign (and stop at it). The workers also review situations where the system failed to respond properly and a driver had to take back control of the vehicle.The annotators label videos where the system worked properly and instances when it malfunctioned. By ID'ing issues, the data-annotation team can update Tesla's global database with new information to clear up any confusion for other Teslas that encounter the same situations. Put simply, they teach Tesla's AI that the stop sign at First and Main is part of a four-way stop.Analyzing data from Musk's vehicles has been a priority since the program's inception, multiple workers said.Eight workers said they recalled labeling data that they believed was associated with the billionaire. Two workers said they labeled a route in 2021 that went in and out of the driveway of a mansion in Hillsborough, California, that they later discovered belonged to Musk. The Tesla CEO sold the house in November 2021 for $32 million.Several workers said they spent a significant amount of time labeling routes in and out of Tesla's Austin and Fremont, California, factories, as well as the SpaceX office in Hawthorne, California.While the annotators could have been viewing data from other Tesla employees or SpaceX workers who owned Teslas, they said the same focus was not given to other factory or office parking lots in California or elsewhere. In addition, one recalled labeling a series of clips from late 2022 and early 2023 that involved Twitter's headquarters in San Francisco. The worker said the team was told to focus on data from areas near Twitter headquarters during the same time period that Musk took control of the social-media company.John Bernal, a former Autopilot analyst and test driver, and three other former workers told BI they were informed they were working on data from Musk's car and specifically told to treat the clips with care. While workers at the data-labeling plants are typically rated on how fast they can annotate the data, Bernal and two other workers said they were told to take more time with data from Musk's vehicles, adding that the clips would go through an extra round of quality assurance as well.\"It seems pretty clear that Elon's experience would be better than anyone else's,\" one former employee said. \"He was seeing the software at its best.\"Another worker said they had some misgivings about the initiative.\"It seemed like we were purposely making his car better to make Autopilot look different than it was,\" another former employee said. \"It felt dishonest.\"Four other workers said they believed they'd labeled routes associated with Musk but had not been expressly told by supervisors. When annotators view the data, they can see a timestamp from when the footage was taken and the geolocation, but they're unable to view anything that explicitly identifies the specific vehicle or driver. Instead, annotators said they could rely on context clues, particularly the routes and locations the vehicle visited.Some workers said the cost of failing to label Musk's data correctly could be high. Two former workers recalled an incident where a data annotator was terminated shortly after labeling a clip they believed came from Musk's car. The worker was escorted out of Tesla's facility in Buffalo, New York, the workers said, after the data labeler failed to properly label a highway exit sign. One former worker said it was highly unusual for someone in data annotation to be fired without warning and that the employees were typically put on notice if they were not hitting their metrics.One former worker told BI they recalled labeling a route in 2020 from a house in Los Angeles to SpaceX's headquarters in Hawthorne, where the software struggled to identify the lines on the road toward an off-ramp. Tesla's Autopilot software has struggled to follow patchy lane markings in the past. In Walter Isaacson's biography on Musk, the author said that earlier on in the Autopilot program, Tesla persuaded a \"Musk fan\" at the California Department of Transportation to repaint the lines on Interstate 405 after Musk encountered issues with Autopilot as a result of the faded lane markings.However, one former worker said there was no way for any of the labelers to know with certainty whether the clip belonged to any one driver, adding that anyone who thinks they know the owner of the car would be operating on \"pure speculation.\"Representatives for Tesla and Musk did not reply when reached for comment.Musk isn't the only driver that gets special treatment.Since FSD was released in 2020, Tesla fans and critics alike have taken to social media to share videos of the technology succeeding and failing, from clips of it navigating difficult routes without human intervention to buggy videos showing the car running over toddler-sized dummies or mistaking the moon for a stop light.These videos do not go unnoticed by Tesla staff. In fact, the company created a system to prioritize data from drivers most likely to share their experience online, three current and former workers with direct knowledge of the issue told BI. These drivers are internally referred to as \"VIP\" users and their data is at times put in VIP queues, according to the workers.Data collected from VIP users, including high-profile Tesla drivers who post on YouTube, is scrutinized more heavily and more likely to be labeled, three current and former workers said. They said they'd been specifically told by leads on their teams that they were working on \"VIP data\" and had received overtime pay to work on the data ahead of FSD updates.\"We would annotate every area that car regularly drove in,\" one former worker, who said they were told by their manager they were working on \"Tesla influencer\" data, added. \"We'd home in on where they lived and label everything we could along that route.\"Bernal said that Tesla sent multiple test drivers out to routes YouTubers had driven, including routes driven by Raj Balwani and Chuck Cook, two YouTubers who often review the software.Bernal said he was one of eight or nine test drivers who went to Lombard Street to work on a solution, after Balwani, also known by his YouTube account Tesla Raj, posted a video of FSD repeatedly attempting to veer off the famously curvy road. The company eventually coded invisible barriers into the system to fix the issue specifically for Lombard Street, according to Bernal. (Bernal was terminated in 2022. He said it was the result of sharing a series of videos on his YouTube channel of his personal Tesla malfunctioning while using FSD.)Balwani told BI he'd never been contacted by any Tesla employees regarding his videos but that he saw the company's focus on online feedback as a positive sign.\"I think this just means that their teams are monitoring and are engaged in the areas that they need to be,\" Balwani said\"For most of what I've recorded and done since I've had FSD, almost everything has been solved, which is pretty incredible,\" he added.In 2022, Musk congratulated Cook on Twitter for giving Tesla a \"tough case to solve\" after the carmaker rolled out an update meant to address an issue with unprotected left turns that Cook had pointed out in his videos.Cook told BI he's very aware of Tesla's focus on his content \u2014 in fact, he said, he sees test drivers in his neighborhood on a weekly basis. The YouTuber said he'd attempted to reach out to Autopilot engineers over email and social media but that they never responded and the test drivers in his neighborhood had been very \"tight-lipped\" about their work.Cook said he sent an email in 2020 to an account for FSD beta testers asking whether Tesla was really looking at his data.\"They sent a screenshot of what my camera was seeing in my car just 30 minutes prior,\" he said.Cook feels Tesla is focused less on handpicking influencers and more on gathering the best data for training, he said.\"They know I'm not just blabbing and fanboying or overcriticizing,\" Cook said. \"I'm fair.\"One worker with knowledge of the issue said the VIP system wasn't designed to give preferential treatment but served as an additional method for Tesla to improve FSD for all drivers.YouTubers are \"going out and constantly trying to break the system,\" the worker said, adding: \"They're identifying difficulties that could be translated to other routes and calling attention to them.\"\"In a way, they're a second tier of test drivers,\" they added.But Tesla's focus on Musk and VIP users could be detrimental to the company's efforts to achieve truly autonomous driving, Missy Cummings, a former safety advisor for the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, said.\"It's going to be hard to make a self-driving car for the masses if it's only operating well around Elon's house,\" Cummings told BI.The issue comes down to whether Tesla's focus on VIP users contributes to niche improvements like the fixes to Lombard Street or ones that will benefit the entire community, Philip Koopman, a computer-engineering expert out of Carnegie Mellon University, told BI.\"I expect there is marketing pressure to make the VIP drivers look good in their videos, and it's hard to know how much of that is theater and how much is reality without Tesla disclosing the amount of safety improvements provided by each change,\" Koopman said.Tesla has come under increasing scrutiny from regulators over the self-driving software and the company's marketing of the service. In April, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's investigation into Tesla's Autopilot and Full Self-Driving linked it to hundreds of crashes and dozens of deaths, citing inadequate measures to ensure driver attention.Additionally, the US Justice Department is investigating whether Tesla committed securities or wire fraud over claims that it misled investors and consumers about its electric vehicles' self-driving capabilities.Meanwhile, Musk has repeatedly said Tesla is getting closer to its self-driving goal, including plans to unveil its Robotaxi service later this year.Musk sees Autopilot and FSD as existentially important for Tesla. Self-driving, he said in a 2022 interview, is \"really the difference between Tesla being worth a lot of money or worth basically zero.\"Do you work for Tesla or have a tip?

        "text": "When Jake Bishop and his wife Courtney realized their daughter Hazel was ready to bid farewell to her pacifier, they wanted to make the occasion memorable. Hazel, their lively 3-year-old, had been showing signs for a while that she was prepared to part with her pacifier. With her third birthday approaching, they felt it was the ideal moment for her to make the transition. After researching online, Jake, an artist from St. Louis, Missouri, came across videos of people burying pacifiers in the ground as a symbolic farewell. Inspired by the idea, he decided to organize a funeral for Hazel's pacifier on May 18, the day before her birthday. Before the ceremony, Jake, 34, rushed downstairs to grab his notepad and pen. \"I grabbed a suit jacket, tied on a tie \u2014 haphazardly \u2014 and snagged the crocs by the door. That was it,\" Jake tells PEOPLE exclusively. \"It was a spontaneous five-minute thing, a let's-see-what-happens and have-fun-with-it moment,\" he adds. \"But it was truly led by Hazel. We wanted to give her the chance to do this herself and take that next step, with plenty of support at home.\" Never miss a story \u2014 sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from juicy celebrity news to compelling human interest stories. During the ceremony, Jake delivered his eulogy and mimicked some of Hazel's pacifier noises. \"Hello, everyone. We are gathered here to remember Pass 'The Pacifier' Bishop, one of the greatest pacis to have ever graced the lips of a toddler,\" Jake said in part during his speech. \"From our mouths to our hearts, paci brought a sense of peace and calm to our Hazel Jean.\" Afterwards, the family buried the pacifier in the backyard, closing the impromptu event with a salute and bagpipe music. \"I did this,\" Hazel proudly saluted. \"Our restless little girl is always on the move,\" Jake says. \"Her sitting through the pacifier funeral for as long as she did was impressive.\" The next morning, Hazel woke to find a surprise basket atop the burial site, doubling as her birthday celebration. Inside were lollipops, bath time surprises, glow sticks, Reese's cupcakes and even a rose. \"I also got a new bike!\" Hazel tells PEOPLE excitedly. \"She's been doing amazingly well since then,\" Jake continues. \"She hasn't mentioned the pacifier, hasn't had any meltdowns. She's really embraced this transition to big girlhood. It's been incredible.\" In June, Jake shared a TikTok video of the pacifier funeral, which has gone viral with over 2 million views and 6,000 comments. Jake admits he never expected it to become so big. \"Every time I open the app and see all the notifications, I'm still shocked,\" he says. \"My hand started cramping from keeping up with all the positive and loving comments. It feels really good ... we're letting kids feel emotions, be themselves.\" \"Even tough times like this don't have to be hard,\" he adds. \"They don't have to be painful memories. We can do them in any way we choose, and let these kids lead the way.\"",

        "text": "Criminal Record' (Apple TV+) A wonderfully unfussy detective yarn, Criminal Record follows two London cops \u2014 June Lenker (Cush Jumbo), a relative newcomer to the force, and Daniel Hegarty (Peter Capaldi), a respected veteran and part of the department\u2019s old-white-guy wall of silence \u2014 as they clash over the 2012 conviction of a Black man (Tom Moutchi) for his girlfriend\u2019s murder. Created by Paul Rutman (Indian Summers), Criminal Record eschews narrative gimmicks in favor of a straightforward \u2014 and superbly nuanced \u2014 story about generational conflict, the intractability of institutional racism and sexism, and the quiet satisfaction of tenacious police work. That, and the absolute brilliance of Capaldi and Jumbo as well-matched foils, is all the razzle-dazzle this drama needs. Read the full review of Criminal Record. 'Sh\u014dgun' (FX) In an era of second-screen viewing, Sh\u014dgun is the rare show that requires \u2014 and earns \u2014 our full attention. This opulently produced, sprawling adaptation of James Clavell\u2019s bestselling novel makes a knotty power struggle between feudal Japanese leaders into a riveting \u2014 and sometimes laugh-out-loud funny \u2014 historical soap opera. Anchored by the romance between Mariko (Anna Sawai), loyal interpreter for Lord Toranaga (Hiroyuki Sanada), and captive British sailor John Blackthorne (Cosmo Jarvis), Sh\u014dgun is an epic, moving testament to the transcendent power of honor and sacrifice. Read the full review of Sh\u014dgun. 'The Vince Staples Show' (Netflix) I went in expecting a Curb-style meta-spoof about Vince Staples\u2019 life as a well-known rapper and actor. Instead, this five-episode reverie offers a dark, funny exploration of the 31-year-old\u2019s attempt to exist outside of the spotlight in Long Beach, Calif. Navigating challenges from the banal (a condescending bank manager; cops who confuse him for another Black man) to the surreal (amusement park mascots hellbent on vengeance), Staples presents himself as a guy whose biggest goal in life isn\u2019t fame \u2014 it\u2019s uneventful anonymity. Featuring an exceptional performance from Vanessa Bell Calloway (as Vince\u2019s hilariously ill-tempered mom, Anita) and a shockingly bleak cliffhanger, The Vince Staples Show might just be the most underappreciated comedy of the year. Read the full review of The Vince Staples Show. 'Mr. & Mrs. Smith' (Prime Video) Another stellar entry in the recent wave of nostalgic procedural mysteries (see: Peacock\u2019s Poker Face, CBS\u2019 Elsbeth). This TV-series spin on the 2005 Brad and Angie blockbuster pairs globe-trotting, big-budget spy adventures with a sharp and comedic portrait of a marriage in nearly constant crisis. Bolstered by the undeniable chemistry of leads Donald Glover and Maya Erskine (who may or may not return for season 2) and packed with Emmy-worthy guest stars, Mr. & Mrs. Smith is the exception to the \u201cmost reboots are unnecessary\u201d rule. Read the full review of Mr. & Mrs. Smith. 'Hacks' (Max) In its seamless third season, Hacks finds an authentic way to bring wealthy, whip-smart comedian Deborah Vance (Jean Smart) and her rising-star writer, Ava Daniels (Hannah Einbinder) back together, evolving their relationship from one of cross-generational mentorship to true \u2014 but turbulent \u2014 friendship. Even with two scene-stealing stars to service, Hacks managed to mine new comedic gold with the essential ensemble (three words: \u201cWhat a c---!\u201d) and guest casting that was unpredictable yet perfectly on point. \u201cMy mom\u2019s Deidre Hall from Days of Our Lives,\u201d notes Deborah\u2019s agent, Jimmy (Paul W. Downs), casually uttering one of the biggest TV reveals of the year. Yes, these Hacks are at the top of their game. 'Evil' (Paramount+) Evil began as a smart but somewhat routine science-vs.-religion procedural, following a trio of supernatural assessors \u2014 forensic psychologist Dr. Kristen Bouchard (Katja Herbers), Father David Acosta (Mike Colter), and atheist/tech whiz Ben Shakir (Aasif Mandvi) \u2014 working for the Catholic church. Four increasingly weird seasons and one liberating network change later, Robert and Michelle King\u2019s drama is an otherworldly wonder that interprets the dread of modern living through pitch-black humor, empathy, and an unfaltering undercurrent of hope. The final season finds snide and sinister psychologist/devil-worshipper Leland Townsend (Michael Emerson) struggling to be a single father to a cute baby boy named Timothy \u2014 a.k.a. the \u201cliving Antichrist\u201d \u2014 while Kristen wrestles with the urgent desire to tune out of our grim reality. \u201cMore and more,\u201d she laments, \u201ceverything seems threatening.\u201d Thank all the gods for Evil, which reassures us that there\u2019s nothing more human than being afraid. 'Fantasmas' (HBO) \u201cI wake up and I just sort of Julio.\u201d Indeed, that\u2019s just what Julio Torres \u2014comedian, visionary, and creator/star of Fantasmas \u2014 does throughout this five-part fantasy set in a cartoonishly dystopian New York. Desperate to avoid the prison of conformity, be it an \u201cunremarkable black puffer coat\u201d or the government-issued \u201cProof of Existence\u201d card, Julio searches for an all-important oyster earring. Meanwhile, Fantasmas veers into lavishly absurd vignettes, featuring some of the most delightful guest-star turns of the year. (Steve Buscemi as the letter Q! Pose\u2019s Dominque Jackson as the Algorithm! Emma Stone as a Real Housewives-esque reality star!) In the end, Julio learns that the power to be exceptional (and exceptionally weird) was inside him all along. 'Fallout' (Prime Video) There\u2019s nothing like a nuclear apocalypse to shatter a person\u2019s faith in humanity. But 200 years after the end of the world, rule-following patriot Lucy MacLean (Ella Purnell) works to be a model citizen in her subterranean survival vault so she can one day emerge and help rebuild the nuke-shattered society. Aboveground, though, it\u2019s every man, mutated mega-salamander, and irradiated zombie humanoid (Walton Goggins) for himself. A multifaceted apocalypse adventure that interrogates the concept of self-governance through the lens of morality, nihilism, and \u201cthe great game of capitalism,\u201d Fallout believes that not even an A-bomb can eradicate our nation\u2019s determination to survive. Read the full review of Fallout. 'The Traitors' (Peacock) In season 2, this \u201cmurder\u201d-mystery competition ditched the dead weight of real-people contestants, stacking a grand Scottish castle with reality TV luminaries, fame-adjacent public figures, even a former U.K. politician \u2014 and may the best manipulator win. Lording over the deliciously melodramatic proceedings is Alan Cumming, whose theatrical commitment to the bit puts most reality TV hosts to shame. 'The Jerrod Carmichael Reality Show' (HBO) \u201cCameras make me feel more comfortable. It feels permanent and it seems dumb to lie. I keep saying I want to live more truthfully.\u201d With that as his mission statement, comedian Jerrod Carmichael delivered the realest celebrity reality show since\u2026 maybe ever? Eschewing the impulse to curate his life for the cameras, Carmichael instead shows us everything: Cheating on his boyfriend with a series of grindr hookups; letting down a close friend on his wedding day; confronting his dad, Joe, over his infidelity and his mom, Cynthia, for her Bible-based rejection of his homosexuality. Painful and cringe-inducing as it can be, the Jerrod Carmichael Reality Show finds its power and purpose in radical, almost revolutionary, transparency.

It was Russia\u2019s heaviest bombardment of Kyiv in almost four months and one of the deadliest of the war, hitting seven of the city\u2019s 10 districts. The strike on the Okhmatdyt children\u2019s hospital, which interrupted open-heart surgery and forced young cancer patients to take their treatments outdoors, drew an international outcry. The 10-story hospital, Ukraine's largest medical facility for children, was caring for some 670 patients at the time of the attack, Okhmatdyt\u2019s Director General, Volodymyr Zhovnir, said Tuesday. The missile hit a two-story wing of the hospital. \u201cThe building where we conducted dialysis for children with kidney failure or acute intoxication is ruined entirely,\u201d he told reporters, estimating the overall damage to the hospital at $2.5 million. Danielle Bell, the head of a U.N. team tracking human rights violations in Ukraine, said at least two people were killed at the hospital and some 50 people were injured, including seven children. The casualty figure would have been much higher if patients hadn't been taken to a bunker when air raid sirens first sounded, she added. Zhovnir said one of the two killed at the hospital was a female doctor who took children to the shelter and then went back to check nobody had been left behind Oleh Holubchenko, a pediatric surgeon at the hospital, was operating on a baby with congenital face defects. Despite the blast of air sirens, he and his team decided to continue with the operation. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t stop halfway through,\u201d he told The Associated Press. When the missile struck, the shock wave flung him across the operating theater. Shrapnel caused him minor injuries and pierced the infant's ventilator. The baby, still with an open wound, had to be transported to another Kyiv hospital where they finished the surgery. Authorities were working to restore the hospital's power and water supply as Kyiv city administrators declared Tuesday an official day of mourning. Entertainment events were prohibited and flags were lowered in the capital. Russia denied responsibility for the hospital strike, insisting it doesn\u2019t attack civilian targets in Ukraine despite abundant evidence to the contrary, including Associated Press reporting. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov on Tuesday repeated that position, pointing to a Russian Defense Ministry statement that blamed a Ukrainian air defense missile for partially destroying the hospital. Bell, the head of the U.N. team, dismissed that argument. She said an assessment of video footage and findings on site indicated the hospital \u201ctook a direct hit, rather than receiving damage due to an intercepted weapons system.\u201d The hospital likely was struck by a Russian Kh-101 cruise missile, Bell said. Ukrainian officials said the same. Over the past year, Moscow has been honing tactics to break through Ukraine\u2019s air defense, said Alexander Kovalenko, a military analyst from Resistance, a nongovernmental information group. Russia used a large number of various types of missile Monday that, arriving together, made it hard for Ukrainian air defenses to intercept them, he said. \u201cThey have been experimenting with different kinds of rockets since 2023 to find the perfect combination to break through our air defense algorithms,\u201d he told The AP. Russian forces have also programmed missiles to maneuver mid-air, according to Kovalenko, who added that during Monday\u2019s attack, a missile appeared at first to head further west, but then swerved back to strike Kyiv, Kovalenko said. The bodies of three more people were found Tuesday under the rubble of a residential building in the Shevchenkivskyi district of Kyiv, officials said, bringing the death toll in the single building to 10. The Russian onslaught Monday came on the eve of a NATO summit in Washington where alliance countries are expected to pledge new military and economic support for Ukraine. Russian President Vladimir Putin, meanwhile, was hosting India\u2019s Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Moscow. New Delhi\u2019s importance as a key trading partner has grown since the Kremlin sent troops into Ukraine in February 2022. Zelenskyy was deeply critical of Modi\u2019s visit, saying on X late Monday: \u201cIt is a huge disappointment and a devastating blow to peace efforts to see the leader of the world\u2019s largest democracy hug the world\u2019s most bloody criminal in Moscow on such a day.\u201d Meanwhile, Russian military and regional officials said Tuesday that Ukrainian drones targeted six Russian regions overnight, in what appeared to be a bigger-than-usual aerial attack by Kyiv's forces. Russia\u2019s Defense Ministry said air defense systems in five Russian southern and western regions \u201cdestroyed and intercepted\u201d a total of 38 Ukrainian drones. ___ Jamey Keaten in Geneva contributed.",

        "text": "It was supposed to be a show of strength -- the leaders of NATO's member countries gathering in Washington, D.C., to display their remarkable unity in the face of some of the most serious threats to the alliance in its 75-year history. Instead, the spotlight will fall on the summit's host, President Joe Biden, and growing doubts about his capability to serve as president and represent the United States on the world stage for another four years. But as former President Donald Trump edges ahead in some polls, the looming U.S. election in November has also infused new urgency into some of NATO's key priorities. Among the anticipated events of the three-day summit are a commemoration event Tuesday at the Mellon Auditorium, the site where the NATO treaty was formally signed in 1949; a bilateral meeting with newly elected U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer; a meeting with the EU and NATO's Indo-Pacific partners; and an event with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and nearly two dozen allies and partners who have signed bilateral security agreements with Ukraine. On Thursday evening, Biden will hold a rare solo press conference, which he hasn't done since November. Here are the top storylines to watch: Biden's next big test After Biden's debate performance last month ignited panic among Democrats, his campaign has been urgently searching for opportunities to undo damage and prove the president can be an effective leader for the future. The president himself has set the stakes for the summit remarkably high. He mentioned the alliance six times during his 21-minute interview with ABC News anchor George Stephanopoulos on Friday, saying the event would be \"a good way to judge me.\" But the optics for Biden's campaign may not be ideal. The summit will mark the 75th anniversary of the alliance, and among its 32 members, Biden is the only head of government who was alive during its founding. The president, 81, will share stages with leaders like France's Emmanuel Macron, Denmark's Mette Frederiksen and plenty of other officials who are about half his age. In preparation for the summit, officials say Biden has spent hours huddling with Secretary of State Antony Blinken at the White House -- including on the eve of the summit and over the Fourth of July holiday. Blinken is also expected to be by Biden's side through much of the programming in Washington, according to the officials. Despite reports claiming U.S. allies have privately questioned Biden's ability to lead, the White House rejected the notion they needed reassurance from the president. \"We're not picking up any signs of that from our allies at all. Quite the contrary. The conversations that we're having with them in advance is they're excited about this summit,\" White House national security communications adviser John Kirby said on Monday. Ukraine\u2019s road to membership Hours before the start of the summit on Tuesday, a barrage of Russian missiles rained down on Ukraine, hitting multiple civilian targets -- including a children's hospital. The attack -- which left at least 37 people dead, according to Ukrainian officials -- underscored the gravity of the conflict that has indirectly pitted NATO powers against Moscow's aggression. Before Monday's strike on Ukraine, a senior Biden administration official said that the U.S. would announce new air defenses and military capabilities for the country, adding that the summit would send \"a strong signal\" to Russian President Vladimir Putin \"that if he thinks he can outlast the coalition of countries supporting Ukraine, he's dead wrong.\" While Zelenskyy has been pushing for additional air defense systems, he has been critical of NATO's decision to avoid setting a timeline for Ukraine to join its ranks. A major focus of the Washington summit is expected to be what members of the alliance have branded as Ukraine's \"bridge to membership\" -- a longer-term effort aimed at steadily moving the country on a path toward becoming a NATO member. In line with this aim, the alliance is expected to announce additional steps to boost tactical cooperation and force development in the coming days and financial pledges, as well as a host of security agreements between Ukraine and individual NATO members, according to Biden administration officials. A \"Trump-proof\" NATO? Long before the presidential debate in June, NATO observers have been buzzing about efforts to ensure the alliance can stay the course through political headwinds churned up by changes in leadership. While the alliance's secretary-general, Jens Stoltenberg, is scheduled to step down this fall, much of the attention has been fixed on the U.S. election and what pundits describe as a race to \"Trump-proof\" the alliance, which the former president has repeatedly threatened to leave. (Trump also said in February he wouldn't protect a NATO nation that didn't contribute enough defense funds and, instead, he'd \"encourage\" Russia \"to do whatever the hell they want.\") \"Arguably, despite Russia's continued revanchism, the greatest challenge to NATO today comes from within the alliance -- particularly rising populism and publics that continue to question the value of the alliances -- rather than from adversaries abroad,\" said Raphael S. Cohen, a senior political scientist at the RAND Corporation. He argues that addressing that challenge relies on individual members meeting NATO's guidelines calling for each country to commit at least 2% of its GDP to defense spending -- a target 23 of its 32 members are currently meeting. \"It could change not only many American perceptions of the value of NATO but also change European security -- if not global security -- for the better,\" Cohen said. But members of the administration who believe a second Trump term in office would do irrevocable harm to the alliance say there's only so much that NATO can do to minimize the impact. Multiple U.S. officials aligned with Biden told ABC News that although the summit isn't shaping up to be the celebration of the president's foreign policy accomplishments that they anticipated, they hope the summit will draw attention to how a Trump victory in November could damage America's standing internationally.

        "text": "SANTA FE, NM (AP) \u2014 Alec Baldwin\u2019s trial in the shooting of a cinematographer is set to begin Tuesday with the selection of jurors who will be tasked with deciding whether the actor is guilty of involuntary manslaughter. Getting chosen to serve in a trial of such a major star accused of such a major crime would be unusual even in Los Angeles or Baldwin\u2019s hometown of New York. But it will be essentially an unheard-of experience for those who are picked as jurors in Santa Fe, NM, though the state has increasingly become a hub of Hollywood production in recent years. Baldwin, 66, could get up to 18 months in prison if jurors unanimously decide he committed the felony when a revolver he was pointing at cinematographer Halyna Hutchins went off, killing her and wounding director Joel Souza during a rehearsal for the Western film \u201cRust\u201d in October 2021 at Bonanza Creek Ranch, some 18 miles (29 kilometers) from where the trial is being held. Baldwin has said the gun fired accidentally after he followed instructions to point it toward Hutchins, who was behind the camera. Unaware the gun contained a live round, Baldwin said he pulled back the hammer \u2014 not the trigger \u2014 and it fired. The star of \u201c30 Rock\u201d and \u201cThe Hunt for Red October\u201d made his first appearance in the courtroom on Monday, when Judge Mary Marlowe Summer, in a significant victory for the defense, ruled at a pretrial hearing that Baldwin\u2019s role as a co-producer on \u201cRust\u201d isn\u2019t relevant to the trial. The judge has said that the special circumstances of a celebrity trial shouldn\u2019t keep jury selection from moving quickly, and that opening statements should begin Wednesday. \u201cI\u2019m not worried about being able to pick a jury in one day,\u201d Marlowe Summer said. \u201cI think we\u2019re going to pick a jury by the afternoon.\u201d Special prosecutor Kari Morrissey, however, was dubious that Baldwin\u2019s lawyers, with whom she has clashed in the run-up to the trial, would make that possible. \u201cIt is my guess that with this group of defense attorneys, that\u2019s not gonna happen,\u201d Morrissey said at the hearing. Baldwin attorney Alex Spiro replied, \u201cI\u2019ve never not picked a jury in one day. I can\u2019t imagine that this would be the first time.\u201d Dozens of prospective jurors will be brought into the courtroom for questioning Tuesday morning. Cameras that will carry the rest of the proceedings will be turned off to protect their privacy. Jurors are expected to get the case after a nine-day trial. Attorneys will be able to request they be dismissed for conflicts or other causes. The defense under state law can dismiss up to five jurors without giving a reason, the prosecution three. More challenges will be allowed when four expected alternates are chosen. Before Marlowe Sommer\u2019s ruling Monday, prosecutors had hoped to highlight Baldwin\u2019s safety obligations on the set as co-producer to bolster an alternative theory of guilt beyond his alleged negligent use of a firearm. They aimed to link Baldwin\u2019s behavior to \u201ctotal disregard or indifference for the safety of others\u201d under the involuntary manslaughter law. But the prosecution managed other wins Monday. They successfully argued for the exclusion of summary findings from a state workplace safety investigation that placed much of the blame on the film\u2019s assistant director, shifting fault away from Baldwin. And the judge ruled that they could show graphic images from Hutchins\u2019 autopsy, and from police lapel cameras during the treatment of her injuries.",

The plane was a Boeing 757-200 and there were 174 passengers on board, plus seven crew members. The airline also confirmed that there were \"no reported injuries on the aircraft or on the ground\" during the incident. The Federal Aviation Administration told PEOPLE it was investigating, and that the plane had \"landed safely\" at Denver International Airport around 10:10 a.m. local time. Passenger Allen Stubblefield told Good Morning America that the plane \"landed with a thump.\" \"The plane was going straight down the runway,\" he continued, admitting, \"It felt normal.\" Monday's incident comes after a wheel fell off United Airlines Flight 35 \u2014 which was headed to Osaka, Japan \u2014 on March 7. The plane was diverted to L.A. shortly after taking off from San Francisco International Airport when the wheel fell off the Boeing 777-200 aircraft, an United Airlines spokesperson told PEOPLE at the time. There were 235 customers, 10 flight attendants and four pilots on board. As previously reported by PEOPLE, the wheel landed on two vehicles in the airport's employee parking lot, causing quite a bit of damage. \"We\u2019re grateful to our pilots and flight attendants for their professionalism in managing this situation,\" the airline said in a statement at the time, adding that the plane was \"designed to land safely with missing or damaged tires,\" and had 12 tires on both of its main landing gear struts.

We will work with customers as well as with the owners of the damaged vehicles in SFO to ensure their needs are addressed,\" the airline continued. The latest wheel incident came hours before PEOPLE reported Boeing would plead guilty to one count of conspiracy to defraud the United States as part of an agreement with the Justice Department. The charge relates to two fatal 737 MAX 8 jet crashes that killed a combined 346 people, stemming from the 2018 crash of a Lion Air flight and the 2019 crash of an Ethiopian Airlines flight.",

        "text": "More than one in three offices in San Francisco are vacant despite an artificial intelligence boom that has boosted the stocks of major tech giants based in Silicon Valley, according to a report. Real estate firm Cushman & Wakefield found that the vacancy rate for office space in San Francisco reached a record high of 34.5% in the second quarter \u2014 up from 33.9% in the first quarter. That\u2019s despite the city\u2019s efforts to lure back tech workers who relocated during the COVID pandemic to other locales with cheaper cost of living, lower taxes and fewer incidents of crime. In the second quarter of last year, the office vacancy rate in the city was 28.1%. Before the COVID pandemic, the office vacancy rate was just 5%, according to CNBC. The dire state of office space in San Francisco has forced landlords to slash asking prices for rent to their lowest level in nearly a decade. The average rent fell in the second quarter to $68.27 per square foot \u2014 the lowest since 2015, according to Cushman & Wakefield. That\u2019s down from $72.90 per square foot last year and $84.70 per square foot before the pandemic. Earlier this year, commercial real estate firm CBRE predicted that it could take years for the city\u2019s office market to fully recover. The company\u2019s report found that while the total vacancy rate was increasing, the rate at which it was increasing had slowed a bit. San Francisco\u2019s downtown managed to attract artificial intelligence startups who took up office space in the area. Last year, Anthropic, the Amazon-backed rival to ChatGPT maker OpenAI, subleased 230,000 square feet of office space that once served as headquarters for Slack. OpenAI, the world\u2019s most valuable AI company, announced last fall that it would be leasing around 500,000 square feet of office space in the Mission Bay section of the city \u2014 the biggest lease of office space in San Francisco since 2018. In May, Scale AI signed a lease to move in to Airbnb\u2019s office building, where it will take up around 180,000 square feet of space. While AI firms have cast a vote of confidence in San Francisco, so far the companies have been unable to save the city\u2019s commercial real estate sector from its dire straits. \u201cSan Francisco is certainly the center of AI, but AI is not going to save the San Francisco commercial real estate market,\u201d Robert Sammons, senior research director at Cushman & Wakefield, told CNBC. \u201cIt will help.\u201d The Bay Area has long reigned as the country\u2019s key hub for tech companies. But the pandemic marked an inflection point for the city. Since 2020, at least 53 companies have moved their headquarters out of San Francisco and the Bay Area. Among the most high-profile firms that took part in the exodus were electric car maker Tesla, cybersecurity firm McAfee, software giant Oracle, computer manufacturer Hewlett Packard and the data analytics unicorn Palantir. The advent of remote and hybrid work schedules has also prompted dozens of other tech companies such as Meta, PayPal, Google parent Alphabet, Slack and Salesforce to reduce its office footprint in the city. San Francisco has also seen several popular retail brands shutter stores, including Nordstrom, Whole Foods, Old Navy and the Westfield San Francisco Centre shopping mall.",

        "text": "For Kaitlyn Bristowe, it wasn\u2019t an easy choice to move into her new Nashville home \u2014 but it turned out to be the right one. \u201cHonestly, I thought I would move out of my old house and feel regret like, \u2018What am I doing?\u2019\u201d the Bachelorette star and podcast host tells PEOPLE. \u201cI had made it my dream home, I'd done these renovations, I had made it exactly what I wanted it to be,\u201d she continues. \u201cAnd then as soon as I moved into this home, it really felt like it was meant to be.\u201d Until August 2023, Bristowe shared her former Nashville abode with her ex-fianc\u00e9 Jason Tartick. Tartick moved out after the couple announced the end of their engagement earlier that month. \u201cI was so ready to move on,\u201d Bristowe says. \u201cIt was just, I didn't realize I really hang on to bases and homes and memories and I'm sentimental like that. And so I thought I was going to grieve the house a little more, but really, it felt like a release.\u201d The reality star, 39, says the process of buying a house on her own was \u201cempowering.\u201d \u201cIt kind of forced me to reflect on the last 10 years and see how far I've come and how hard I've worked, and it was a really nice moment for me to go, \u2018Okay.\u2019\u201d \u201cI could look at it like, \u2018I'm this age, I thought I'd be married, I thought I'd have kids, moving into this house with a family,\u2019\u201d she adds. \u201cBut I did a spin zone, I like to call it, and turned a negative into a positive and said that I was really proud of myself for doing this process on my own, for moving into a new house and making it my own, and knowing that when the right time comes, that will all fall into place for me.\u201d Bristowe, who appeared as a contestant on season 19 of The Bachelor in 2015 and then led season 11 of The Bachelorette later that year, also believes the timing was right for a less conventional reason. \u201cI'm into numerology, and it's 10 years since I really started my journey with Bachelor,\u201d she explains. \u201cAnd I heard that at 10 years, there's a new beginning, and so I was like, \u2018How perfect.\u2019 I moved into that old house after the show and I'd been in it for so many years, and this house represents just a fresh start, a new chapter, a new beginning, and new experiences.\u201d Bristowe got engaged to Bachelorette frontrunner Shawn Booth at the end of her season, but the pair eventually split in 2018. She began dating Tartick, who'd competed on season 14 of The Bachelorette, in 2019. Bristowe, who announced in November that she'd put in an offer on the property, says her new house is \u201camazing.\u201d \u201cIt feels like me,\u201d she says. \u201cI feel like it's my sanctuary.\u201d The biggest decorating challenge for the Off the Vine host was discovering that she couldn\u2019t recreate her old house in the new space just because the square footage was similar. \u201cI thought I could just pick up the pieces from the old place and plop them into the new one and that it would work,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd I realized very quickly that that's not how this works, and that each room was so unique.\u201d So Bristowe teamed with the furniture brand Ashley to create the \u201cbonus\u201d room, guest room, and outdoor space of her dreams. \u201cThose are probably three of my favorite rooms in the house,\u201d Bristowe says, adding that she treats the bonus room as a personal movie theater. \u201cI feel like my bonus room looks really trendy, but it's also cozy and there's pieces that look like designer pieces for a fraction of the cost. And there's just subtle accents throughout that make it feel like a cozy lived-in room,\u201d she says. However, Bristowe shares that she probably spends the most time on her outdoor patio. \u201cIt's so hot in Nashville right now, and I still just try and sit out there as much as I can, obviously because I have my two dogs and I love spending time out there with them,\u201d she says. As for her pair of golden retrievers, Ramen and Pinot, their favorite spots are wherever Bristowe is. \u201cI call them my shadows, and it's wherever I am in the house, that seems to be their favorite spot,\u201d she says. \"But the couch that we've got upstairs [in the bonus room], that's probably all of our favorites.\" Never miss a story \u2014 sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from juicy celebrity news to compelling human interest stories. Bristowe, who describes her own aesthetic as \u201cedgy, cozy, chic, and with some character,\u201d says she was happy to have professional help with the interior design. \u201cI really loved working with Ashley because I think people think I would have good judgment for what I would need in a house and what I would want in the space, but I actually really like working with people who know what they're doing,\u201d she says. Bristowe says her personal items are the key to making this house feel like a home. \u201cSome of my family actually laughs at me because I like a lot of knickknacks around the house and little trinkets and I've got a lot of stuff, but I like when a house feels lived in,\u201d she says. \u201cI love photos of all my family and friends from back home, my nieces and nephews,\u201d the Canada native adds. \u201cAdding pictures of people, I feel like that really makes it a home.\u201d",

On Tuesday, July 9, the network dropped the trailer for Time Bandits, the television adaptation of Terry Gilliam's beloved cult classic 1981 movie. Created for the small screen by Jemaine Clement (Flight of the Conchords), Iain Morris (The Inbetweeners) and Taika Waititi (Reservation Dogs), the 10-episode show follows an 11-year-old history buff named Kevin (played by Kal-El Tuck), who discovers his room contains a portal that allows him to travel through space and time. Amid his journey, he becomes the latest recruit of an eccentric, ragtag group of \"expert\" thieves guided by the overly confident Penelope (Lisa Kudrow, who returns with a full-time role in a live-action TV series after celebrated roles in Friends, The Comeback and Web Therapy). Together, they set out on a series of epic adventures through the distance past, with Kevin shedding light on history with the bandits while seeking out treasure and flee evil forces threatening their conquests. Along the way, they \"witness the creation of Stonehenge, escape from dinosaurs in the prehistoric ages, wreak havoc during medieval times, experience the Ice Age and visit ancient civilizations, the Harlem Renaissance\" and more. In addition to Kudrow and Tuck, the series will star Tadhg Murphy (Conversations With Friends), Roger Jean Nsengiyumva (You Don\u2019t Know Me), Rune Temte (Eddie the Eagle), Charlyne Yi (Knocked Up), Rachel House (Heartbreak High), Kiera Thompson (Martyrs Lane), James Dryden (Ready Player One), Felicity Ward (The Office Australia), Francesca Mills (Harlots) and Imaan Hadchiti (Thor: Love and Thunder).

Fajitas & \u2018Ritas to close: \u2018Let\u2019s make these final days unforgettable\u2019 Another late-night Taco Bell coming to Boston area \u2018There won\u2019t be another like it\u2019: What Silvertone means to readers In an email, owner Bradley Fredericks told Boston.com that the landlord at 25 West St. decided to not renew the lease, and the building owners have no future plans that involve a restaurant.\u201cThe decision was not in my hands,\u201d Fredericks said.The restaurant, near college campuses and Theater District venues, was a popular spot among young adults looking for budget-friendly margarita pitchers to share and diners grabbing a pre-show bite in the area. Advertisement:We asked Boston.com readers to share their memories of this decades-old spot ahead of last call. Boston-area diners chimed in, sharing their favorite dishes \u2014 like the fajitas, tequila wings, and of course, the margs \u2014 and stories of first dates, party buses, and Boston celebrity sightings. \u201cI took my girlfriend, now wife of 13 years, there often and we have many great memories of the food and the pitchers of margaritas. One time when we walked in, there was a large gathering in the back area, so we asked the waitress what was going on. Turns out, Tom Brady and Gisele were there with a big party! That was really neat.\u201d \u2013 Mike Stratton, of Grand Rapids, formerly of Boston \u201cThe steak fajitas are probably my favorite. I will miss the convenience, the speed of service, and the price. I have been a customer for more than 30 years.\u201d \u2013 Eamon K. of Everett \u201cWill miss parking a party bus out front for an hour while enjoying some frozen margaritas and sizzling fajitas while waiting for our school dance to finish up. Sending love from BC Class of 2022.\u201d \u2013 Randy K. of Aberdeen \u201cGoing to miss the fabulous margaritas of course! This was our favorite spot before attending any event in Boston. Thanks for the memories!\u201d \u2013 Lisa J. \u201c[A] go-to spot when going to a show. Always friendly people behind the bar. The food was good as well. We will miss it when going to the Opera House.\u201d \u2013 Stanley of Centerville \u201cI met my boyfriend of 17 years there. Andrew was behind the bar for almost 30 years and helped make it the fun place it was. We are both really sad to see it go.\u201d \u2013 Megan B. of Roslindale \u201cI will miss the fun atmosphere, the paintings on the walls, the fajitas, \u2018ritas, and tequila wings.\u201d \u2013 Valerie of North Easton \u201cHaven\u2019t been in years, but it was a great place to meet friends and drink some yummy margaritas. The food was also good. I loved the DIY art on the walls, and the whole vibe of the place was so laid back. We\u2019d spend hours laughing and drinking before we staggered out to our next adventures. So many good memories.\u201d \u2013 Heather S. of Somerville \u201cFajitas & \u2018Ritas has been my favorite Boston restaurant since we heard about it about 20 years ago. Back then you filled out order slips at the table. It has been my go-to dinner stop before a show or Sox game any time I\u2019m near Boston Common. I just brought my father there last week, and he hasn\u2019t stopped raving about the delicious food and the margaritas! Its closing is a great loss to the area. I have so many fond memories, and had so many laughs, and of course so many delicious liters of the best frozen margaritas around.\u201d \u2013 Andrea M. of Nantucket \u201cWhen I first moved to Boston some 20 years ago, my now-husband and I went on more than a few dates at Fajitas & \u2018Ritas. Coming from a very small and incredibly rural area, I was taken with the bold art on the walls and the pitchers of delicious, fruity adulthood. Fajitas & \u2018Ritas is an establishment I will never forget.\u201d \u2013 Christine of Holbrook \u201cDrawing on the paper tablecloths like I was a kid and just having a good time while the margaritas kept pouring while I worked in Boston in my 20s. Great memories!\u201d \u2013 Julie N. of Haverhill \u201cMy husband and I wrote our initials in a heart on the back wall when we started dating in 2006. We just started taking our kids there (8, 6, and 2) to have tasty Mexican and draw on the table paper like we used to 18 years ago when we met. I also used to go with my friends from Emerson in college because the atmosphere was great, the food was good, and it was surprisingly affordable for a college student. I\u2019m really sad to see it closing.\u201d \u2013 Dana G. of East Boston \u201cI will miss smelling like onions for the entire night after filling my belly with fajitas.\u201d \u2013 Jaybo of Chinatown \u201cI will miss the very reasonable prices for all menu items. In a post-pandemic era, where all restaurants have seemingly jacked up their prices to the extreme, Fajitas & \u2018Ritas stayed true to their budget-friendly practices while still keeping the quality of food high. It was my favorite restaurant in Boston, and I am deeply devastated by their closing.\u201d \u2013 Jamie of Boston \u201cThe smell \u2014 I\u2019m serious. That restaurant made the whole entire street smell like fajitas.

In it, he plays Wes, \"a young man down on his luck who seeks out his estranged father (Eric Dane) to help him pursue his dream of becoming a professional motorcycle racer.\" \"With the help of his small-town love interest and a motorcycle-shop owner who moonlights as his mentor, he begins to break down the walls that his father\u2019s absence had built up,\" the synopsis adds.

Speaking with Entertainment Weekly, director Kelly Blatz said One Fast Move \"was inspired by my love for classic, exhilarating sports dramas like The Fighter, Ford v. Ferrari and Rocky.\" \"As a devoted motorcycle enthusiast, I couldn't help but notice the absence of a film centered around the thrilling sport of motorcycle racing,\" he continued. \"With One Fast Move, my team and I dedicated ourselves to creating an authentic film that captures the excitement and danger of motorcycle racing, while also delivering a compelling, character-driven drama.\" Both directed and written by Blatz, 37, the film also stars Edward James Olmos and Maia Reficco, and is distributed by Amazon MGM Studios.

People come to me at every restaurant I go in. I\u2019m a friend of the world,\u201d the actor continued. \u201cBut as far as a fulfilling creative work life, I didn\u2019t write one f------ line. I didn\u2019t write one joke to make people laugh. So it\u2019s been unfulfilling on that level.\u201d Corbett mentioned Emma Stone as someone he admires as an actor who is also involved in the creative process of putting a project together, after producing the films Poor Things and Kinds of Kindness, in collaboration with director Yorgos Lanthimos. \u201cI\u2019m not collaborating with the writers,\u201d Corbett explained. \u201c... Have you ever sat in a waiting room of a doctor\u2019s office for like an hour and been like, \u2018What the f---?\u2019 For me, that\u2019s what making a movie is like, because I\u2019m not part of any creative process.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not a movie actor \u2026 I\u2019m really a television actor and so that has to move quick and that guy\u2019s got to make a million decisions. And we\u2019re not shucking and jiving and going out for wine after,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd so I\u2019m just at this point in my life \u2026 if something seems really, really fun, I\u2019ll say yes.\u201d Corbett\u2019s comments come after his appearance in season two of And Just Like That... in which he reprised his role as Carrie Bradshaw\u2019s love interest Aidan Shaw from the Sex and the City TV series in 2023. During the season, Aidan and Carrie (played by Sarah Jessica Parker) got back together and moved into a new home in New York following Aidan's divorce. The couple\u2019s romance was put in jeopardy, however, by the finale episode as Shaw needed to leave the city for at least five years to tend to his youngest son, Wyatt. In May, Corbett was photographed back on set filming scenes with Parker, 59, in New York City for season three of the show.

        "text": "It makes zero sense and all the sense in the world why Flavor Flav and I have spent the past hour grabbing lunch at New York\u2019s Harvard Club. Built in the 1890s, the stately private social club in midtown Manhattan boasts an elegant dining room with chandeliers, ornate silverware, and for one day, a 65-year-old hip-hop icon wearing sparkly pants, an Olympic women\u2019s water-polo team T-shirt and a Team USA clock dangling from his neck. Like any other place, the Public Enemy hypeman both sticks out and is gleefully welcomed by all. (\u201cFix your shit,\u201d one employee is overheard saying to another. \u201cFlav\u2019s almost here.\u201d) Throughout his career \u2014 but especially in recent years \u2014 Flavor Flav has become music\u2019s de facto good vibes ambassador, posting heartfelt Instagram videos of meeting other musicians (\u201cWoooooooooooow,\u201d he says to a smiling Bruce Springsteen while bowing) and doing absurd shit like trying to save Red Lobster from bankruptcy. (The seafood chain thanked him with his own signature meal.) So when Flavor Flav responded to Olympic water-polo gold medalist Maggie Steffans\u2019 Instagram post in May with \u201cAYYY YOOO,,, as a girl dad and supporter of all women\u2019s sports \u2013 imma personally sponsor you my girl, whatever you need. And imma sponsor the whole team \u2026. That\u2019s a FLAVOR FLAV promise,\u201d it was unclear how serious he meant it. Very serious, it turns out. As the team\u2019s official hypeman, he\u2019s been promoting the team at every opportunity ever since. Later this month, he\u2019ll be on a flight to Paris supporting them in their quest for a fourth consecutive gold medal. \u201cIf everything goes well, I\u2019ll be doing this for the next five years into the next Olympics,\u201d he tells Rolling Stone over a barely touched minestrone soup. \u201cI might even do it for another five.\u201d Four decades into his career, Flav may be more famous and busier now than he\u2019s ever been. Public Enemy continue to tour 37 years after their debut album. A Flavor Flav solo R&B album is in the works, as is a reality show where he goes back to high school to get his diploma. In a wide-ranging discussion, hip-hop\u2019s most famous hypeman waxes about water polo, being \u201cKing Swiftie,\u201d and why he wants to make everyone he meets \u201cfeel like they\u2019re on top of the world.\u201d Let\u2019s start with the obvious: How does Flavor Flav become the official hypeman for the U.S. Olympic women\u2019s water-polo team?My manager ran across Maggie\u2019s post and said, \u201cFlav, this wouldn\u2019t be a bad idea to help these guys out.\u201d Then I read the post and was like, \u201cMan, I would be honored, and I would love to help.\u201d It\u2019s my first time ever doing something like this. One thing about Flavor Flav: He\u2019s always known to be the first to do something and then everybody follows my train after. So hopefully, I might be opening the doors to where other celebs will come out and sponsor some of these Olympic teams. Because nobody\u2019s doing it; not even the government, which is messed up. I said, \u201cYou know what? I\u2019m gonna step up to the plate and give these girls some help.\u201d These girls won three Olympic gold medals doing this hard-ass sport, but they\u2019re not really getting the recognition. A lot of people ain\u2019t really paying attention, and I\u2019d love to see the sport grow. What does it mean specifically to be a water-polo hypeman? What are your goals for the team?My goal is to drive them further to want to do better, feel more comfortable, and get more gold medals. I also want to make sure that these women feel like they\u2019re important and like somebody\u2019s got their back. When you feel like somebody\u2019s got your back, it makes you want to do even better.It\u2019s a side of you most people haven\u2019t seen.Well, let me say this: The reason why a lot of people really haven\u2019t been seeing that side of me is because they been seeing me in a totally different light. Either they see me onstage performing music or they see me on reality-TV shows. But my personal life? Yes, it portrays this part of me. I\u2019ve always been a supporter of women because I respect women a lot. I think a lot of women need more respect than men. I don\u2019t mind being one of the first to show it. If there\u2019s a certain way of life that you would love to see people live, then it wouldn\u2019t be bad for you to try to project that first. Show the example.Were you a fan of the Olympics growing up?Always. Growing up watching [gold medalist figure skater] Peggy Fleming. Nobody did it better than [gold medalist swimmer] Marc Spitz. The great Olga Korbut from way back in the days. And, um, what\u2019s my girl\u2019s name? Nadia Com\u0103neci. One of my favorite historical moments watching on TV was Muhammad Ali lighting the Olympic torch [in 1996]. And one day, hopefully, I\u2019ll get to do it. What\u2019s crazy now is that two of Muhammad Ali\u2019s grandkids ended up being my godchildren. Did you two ever cross paths?I met him two years before he passed away. [His daughter] Rashida is a friend of the family and called me and said, \u201cHey, Flav, Daddy\u2019s here!\u201d I ran down the street and everything to get some pictures. It was a sentimental moment. On his last birthday, they videotaped him with me on FaceTime singing \u201c911 Is a Joke\u201d to him. You\u2019ve been recognized globally for so long. Do you remember the first time you felt famous?It\u2019s difficult for me to answer because it never crossed my mind. Everything just happened, and I just gradually took it in and just lived it. But I think I knew the first time when we were invited to the Soul Train Music Awards to give an award to Michael Jackson [in the 1980s]. I showed my ass off that day. [Soul Train creator] Don Cornelius did not like me; he was not accepting of me because he\u2019s never seen that type of behavior before. I met Don backstage and he said, \u201cLook, brother. That shit you pulled out there was fucked up.\u201d I was a big fan, and he just broke me down. The following year, we were invited back again, and we gave out another award. I saw Don backstage and he said, \u201cBrother, listen. I really tried my best, brother, to keep you off my show. My producers would not let it happen. I don\u2019t know what it is about you.\u201d I read somewhere there\u2019s a reality show in the works about getting your high school diploma. What\u2019s the latest on that?I dropped out in the 10th grade, so I\u2019ve got a real big degree in street education. What made me drop out was me being a Dennis the Menace getting in a lot of trouble, getting locked up, going in and out of jail all the time. Next thing you know, I just ended up not going back to school after the last time that I went to jail. I was in gangs, and I used to be a follower more than a leader. As a little kid, you want to be the one in the neighborhood that everybody\u2019s talking about. And some of those people that I wanted to be like weren\u2019t the right people. Anybody fuck with me, I would beat they ass. If anybody tried to fight me back, they would get fucked up.So what made you decide to get your diploma now at age 65?I always wanted to make my mom happy, and she would have been happy if I would have graduated from high school. So my mom passed away, but to me, the body is nothing but a shell that goes in the ground. We still stay here; it\u2019s just the shell that went in the ground. So my mom is right here right now with us while I\u2019m doing this interview with you. Plus, I really want it. My two older sisters got theirs, and I want to complete the family with education. I\u2019m more focused now. I\u2019m not living with distractions. We gettin\u2019 ready to go into production this year. We\u2019re just trying to find a school for me to join. Is it actually you in a high school desk with the rest of the students?I\u2019m going to regular school every single day. Every day, I wanna go to school and sit in class and learn and take tests like all the other kids. A regular school year is like nine months.Man, listen. Whatever it takes to get my diploma. I don\u2019t want a GED. I want a di-plo-ma. The real shit. I\u2019m doing the program to show people my age that it\u2019s never too late to go back and get your diploma, but it\u2019s also to influence all of the kids that are in school right now to get that piece of paper because you\u2019re gonna have a hard time in life without it. Staying on TV, any thoughts on a Flavor of Love Season Four?[Looks at girlfriend next to him.] No. I been there and done that. With dating shows, I set the tone for reality television already. I\u2019ve got a good fucking woman. I\u2019m not losing what I got. [Picks up recorder.] Fuck. That. I\u2019m putting the anchor around her ankles. She ain\u2019t goin\u2019 no place. Social media can obviously be deceiving, but optically it looks like you\u2019re having one of the best times of your life right now.I\u2019m having a real good time in my life. This time right now is a little more exciting \u2019cause I\u2019m getting to meet some of my favorite people that I\u2019ve never met before. Meeting Cher was so huge to me. Bruce Springsteen was so huge to me. Me learning about Taylor Swift and becoming one of her biggest supporters was huge to me. The Flav-Taylor friendship has been one of the more-endearing stories in music.Man, when I went to her show in Detroit, her fanbase came up to me and embraced me. I had friendship bracelets on both arms. I didn\u2019t really know too much about Taylor Swift \u2014 my girlfriend\u2019s daughter wanted to see her \u2014 and didn\u2019t know it was going to be all of what it ended up to be. Then I went home and listened to some of her lyrics. My favorite song and the one that really made me understand her the most was \u201cBad Blood.\u201d This girl writes about all the actual life experiences she goes through.When I looked at the lyrics, it\u2019s true shit: Me and you, man, we used to be cool, bro. You done fucked up! Our problems are so fucking bad, we can\u2019t even solve them. That\u2019s in a whole bunch of people\u2019s lives. There will be times when people would read the lyrics and break down and analyze a Public Enemy record. I did the same thing with Taylor Swift and ever since then, I started supporting her. [At this point, a ma\u00eetre d\u2019 for the Harvard Club sheepishly comes over. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry to bother you,\u201d he says, \u201dbut I just wanted to say \u2018Welcome back to the club.\u2019\u201d Flav and him embrace.] It\u2019s surreal thinking of her younger fans listening to Public Enemy. You\u2019ve existed as a pop culture figure outside of PE for so long, does it almost feel like you\u2019ve divorced Flavor Flav the performer from Flavor Flav the icon?Flavor Flav is a street character that I made based off of my real life in the streets. The same Flavor Flav that\u2019s onstage with Public Enemy is the same Flavor Flav that\u2019s offstage too. I remember one time I came home like, \u201dYo, Ma, what\u2019s going on?\u201d She was like, \u201dDon\u2019t you come in here with that Flavor Flav shit.\u201d My mom wasn\u2019t having it \u2014 she\u2019s a church lady. But after a while, she got to understand Flavor Flav and started allowing it. I usually cut it off when I\u2019m home with my kids. It\u2019s been 37 years since Public Enemy\u2019s first album. Is it harder to do shows now?Honestly, it\u2019s easier, but I\u2019m more anxious now than back then because what we did back in those days is missing from music and I want to put it back. I\u2019m anxious to put it back. I\u2019m anxious to lead the way again. When I\u2019m onstage with my partner Chuck D, magic happens. A lot of veteran musicians have mixed feelings about performing songs they\u2019ve played so much in the past. It doesn\u2019t seem like you\u2019re in that position.Fuck, no. I love doing all my old-ass songs. If it wasn\u2019t for those old-ass songs, I wouldn\u2019t be the new-ass me. I couldn\u2019t be the new-ass me without all of the support from all of my old-ass fans. You take all my old-ass fans along with the new-ass fans to make the new-ass me.What do you hope your legacy is?That I tried to make a difference within the world. I have a personal goal: Inside of Flavor Flav, there\u2019s not one, not one racist bone in my body. I\u2019m against separatism. This world is made up of a whole bunch of different races of people. But everybody is so fucking separate and divided. No matter what race we come from, no matter what part of the world that we come from, no matter what religion we study, no matter what language we speak, at the end of the day, we\u2019re all brothers and sisters, man. So my goal is to try to combine all the races of the world together as one and build a wall of unity. The only way that I can help make that happen is to speak about it now and hopefully other people will understand and listen to me and try to join me. That\u2019s the only way that I can help make the world change, but I can\u2019t do it by myself. But I can put the word out by myself. It also helps explain your interest in the Olympics. Exactly. And hopefully, there\u2019ll be other celebrities that will follow my trend and help sponsor a lot of these teams that need help with sponsorship. I\u2019m known for opening up new doors. You told CNN that \u201cwhen we die, we become nothing but memories. But we wanna be the most positive memories, the most influential memories, the most innovative memories \u2026 that\u2019s talked about years after our death.\u201d Why is this so important to you?The purpose of me coming into this business is to put smiles on people\u2019s faces and to give people good memories. When people support you, you should be grateful for that. And the person that supports you, you got to make them feel like they\u2019re on top of the world. And so when that person leaves you, you want them to leave with a good feeling about you.That\u2019s why when people come up to me and ask for a picture or a handshake or a hug, sometimes I don\u2019t feel like being fucked with by nobody inside. But these people are the ones that supported me and made me who I am to society. So whatever I\u2019m feeling inside, I gotta cut that shit off and give that fan what they want. Let them leave me with a smile on their face. Let them go home and brag to their families, \u201cHey, I met Flavor!\u201d You give them good memories to take to their graves. You don\u2019t want them to take bad memories of you to their grave. I want everybody to have a good feeling about me. I want everybody to have something positive to say about me. Even years after my death, I want people saying positive shit about me.",

        "text": "Fashionistas did not \u201cheart\u201d this collection. Over the weekend at Berlin Fashion Week, provocative clubwear brand Namilia presented its Spring/Summer 2025 line, with an \u201cI \u2018heart\u2019 Ozempic\u201d shirt that triggered an uproar on social media over controversial couture. In a statement to The Post, Namilia\u2019s co-creative director Nan Li said their critics are missing the point: The \u201cI \u2018heart\u2019 Ozempic\u201d tee is \u201ca piece of pop art commentary and satire\u201d targeting the health and beauty industry\u2019s latest obsession with these controversial weight loss drugs. Namilia\u2019s latest collection, titled \u201cGood Girl Gone Bad,\u201d highlighted society\u2019s sordid obsession with celebrity gossip and paparazzi shots that dominated the culture of the early aughts, when ultra-thin was in among the Von Dutch era \u201cIt\u201d girls. The brand debuted along with a collection of garments adorned with Ed Hardy designs, leather lace-up pants and mini skirts, barely-there one-pieces and a slew of slogan tees that read \u201cfame kills\u201d or \u201ctoo pretty for rehab.\u201d But in its attempt to be satirical with its abrasive Ozempic tank \u2014 a nod to the recent weight loss drug craze that has yielded nationwide shortages and a swell of rumors about which A-lister is taking the once-weekly jab \u2014 the label seems to have missed the mark among the masses. Critics on Instagram slammed Namilia for seemingly promoting eating disorders and unrealistic \u2014 and potentially damaging \u2014 beauty ideals. \u201cThis brand has become way too influential in the past couple of years to be spreading such low, superficial, capitalistic, and toxic values,\u201d wrote one user in a lengthy diatribe. \u201c\u2018Making a statement/joke\u2019 and the statement is just \u2018eating disorders are cool and fun and won\u2019t ruin your life at all,'\u201d sneered one critic. \u201cSNOOZE.\u201d \u201cWhat a poor and distasteful joke. Such a shame,\u201d commented another. \u201cYour brand is incongruous,\u201d one person wrote, criticizing the brand for sending a message of \u201cpure patriarchy.\u201d \u201cHow can you be \u2019empowering\u2019 women by normalizing the use of a medicine that is scarce and that many people do need to live healthily?\u201d \u201cWTF\u2026.really? Are you promoting this?\u201d someone else said in disbelief. Li told The Post he believes that \u201cfashion is a visual tool for political and cultural statements\u201d that can \u201cprovoke discussion\u201d about the current culture. \u201cThe Ozempic craze for us has been played out in a double standard in pop culture,\u201d Li said. \u201cOn one side celebrities and their followers are willing to do anything they can to fit the still prevalent super slim body ideal in pop culture but on the other side nobody is willing to admit to abusing medication to meet the often unrealistic expectations of current beauty standards.\u201d Since the Ozempic boom, there has been a newfound cultural glorification of thinness as more celebrities are seemingly shrinking their silhouettes and those who cannot afford the costly prescription resort to knock-off medication and DIY hacks for budget weight loss. The semaglutide drug, which was initially manufactured for those with Type-2 diabetes, has also been reported to cause a wide array of side effects in users, such as eye conditions or a sunken face. Svelte frames were also en vogue during the heyday of indie sleaze and Y2K in the \u201990s and \u201900s, to which Namilia\u2019s collection pays homage with Y2K trucker hats, shrunken, rhinestone-bedazzled baby tees and pink leopard print fabric. Trashy tramp stamps and belly button piercings are making a comeback, while \u201cBrat Summer\u201d \u2014 inspired by Charli xcx\u2019s club album \u201cBrat\u201d and is defined \u201ca pack of cigs, a Bic lighter and a strappy white top with no bra\u201d \u2014 is gaining viral popularity among Gen Z, or self-proclaimed \u201cbrats.\u201d \u201cNamilia asks why pop culture pushes us to our breaking points for recognition, attention and some kind of belonging? Why does society desperately categorize us into stereotypes only to be disappointed when we fail to fully live up to these impossible standards?\u201d the brand wrote on Instagram. \u201cWhy do we love to watch others fail?\u201d",

        "text": "At least eight people are dead and over two million people are still without electricity after Hurricane Beryl made its way through Louisiana and Texas on Monday, July 8. Houston Mayor John Whitmire confirmed that at least three people have died as a result of the storm in a press conference, and several other county police departments in Texas have also confirmed deaths in their areas. Whitmire noted during his press conference that a man died due to a \u201ctree falling\u201d down on him, which \u201ctook his life,\u201d and another person was killed in a \u201cfire in southeast Houston,\u201d which they believe may have been caused by \u201clightning\u201d that was \u201cstorm-related.\u201d He also noted that a \u201ccivilian employee\u201d of Houston\u2019s Police Department had been killed while \u201cgoing to work\u201d after he got stuck in \u201cflood conditions\u201d on Houston Avenue and floodwaters submerged his car. The Houston Police Department identified the deceased employee as information security officer Russell Richardson, 54, and asked people to keep his family and friends in their \u201cprayers.\u201d A constable in Harris County also confirmed on social media that a 74-year-old woman had died after a \u201ctree fell through the roof\u201d of her home. Meanwhile, the Bossier Parish Sheriff's Office in Louisiana confirmed on social media that a person \u201cwas killed after a tree fell on her house in northeast Benton.\u201d Montgomery County Emergency Management also confirmed to CNN that three people had died, including one man in his 40s who was struck by a fallen tree while he was in his tractor in the eastern part of the county and two others who \u201cwere discovered in a tent in a wooded area in Magnolia.\u201d Montgomery County Emergency Management did not immediately respond to PEOPLE\u2019s request for comment. White House Deputy Communications Director Jennifer Molina shared on X (formerly Twitter) that President Joe Biden called Whitmire and expressed his \u201ccondolences for the loss of life as a result of Hurricane Beryl.\u201d They also noted that Biden assured Whitmire that Texans would \u201chave the resources they need to get through the storm now and to recover going forward.\u201d Officials in the areas impacted by the storm also warn people to keep off roadways and stay away from downed power lines on Tuesday morning as \u201cdangerous driving conditions still exist.\u201d According to poweroutage.us, which tracks power outages across the country, more than 2.3 million people were without power in Texas as of 9 a.m. local time on Tuesday, July 9.

However, a flood watch was issued for states from Arkansas to Michigan on July 9, with a possibility of up to 5 inches of rain, according to NBC News.",

So with the Nordstrom Anniversary Sale finally here \u2014 and hundreds of items discounted \u2014 why not take some shopping inspiration from her years\u2019 worth of tried-and-true recommendations? While the major markdowns are currently only open to Nordstrom Icon cardholders, the brand\u2019s Ambassador and Influencer-level members can start shopping on July 10 and 11, respectively, before deals open to the general public on July 15.

Spanx The Perfect Ankle Tapered Ponte Pants When Page Six Style put these smoothing styles to the test, we found they truly lived up to their \u201cperfect\u201d branding. Oprah first raved about the Perfect Pant in 2019 \u2014 dubbing the original iteration \u201cultra flattering\u201d and telling readers she even called up Spanx founder Sara Blakely to \u201capplaud her\u201d after slipping on a pair. \u201cIn sizes XS to 3X, they have built-in tummy control, so you don\u2019t need to wear compression gear underneath \u2014 you\u2019re already Spanxed!\u201d she raved at the time. Dr. Barbara Sturm Glow Essentials Set Oprah\u2019s skincare go-tos (or should we say, glow-tos?) include plenty of products from Dr. Barbara Sturm. After trying the brand \u2014 on a recommendation from fashion icon Stella McCartney, no less \u2014 she immediately became an investor. \u201cI love it so much that I then called up Dr. Barbara Sturm, and said \u2018I want to invest in your company,'\u201d she said during a panel discussion, per Forbes. \u201cAnd I have never done that before. Ever. So, that\u2019s how good the products are.\u201d Vionic Kimmie Perforated Suede Slip-On Sneaker The media icon has featured Vionic\u2019s support-focused footwear on a whopping three \u201cFavorite Things\u201d lists over the years, highlighting a strikingly similar sneaker to this one in 2017. \u201cTreat feet to these sneakers designed to hug arches and support natural alignment with an orthotic insert,\u201d she raved at the time. Sunday Riley Jumbo Good Genes All-in-One Lactic Acid Treatment Score a good deal on the exfoliating Good Genes serum Oprah featured on her 2018 \u201cFavorite Things\u201d list as part of her \u201cgo-to beauty regimen.\u201d Bravo star Paige DeSorbo is also a fan, raving in a recent Amazon livestream that she\u2019s been using it for five years. Spanx AirEssentials Crewneck Is it any surprise that Oprah\u2019s \u201cgo-to leisure suit\u201d comes from Spanx? She raved about the AirEssentials collection on her 2022 and 2023 lists. While her exact favorites aren\u2019t on sale, this comfy crewneck comes in the same breezy fabric she described as \u201clike buttah.\u201d Barefoot Dreams 2-Pack CozyChic Socks Treat your feet to cozy socks from Barefoot Dreams, which Oprah called \u201cblissfully soft\u201d in 2023.

Save over $30 on the brand\u2019s starter kit with this Nordstrom-exclusive deal. Kiehl\u2019s Creme de Corps Body Moisturizer The former talk show host gave this cult-favorite moisturizer a shout-out on \u201cGood Morning America\u201d in 2012. She\u2019s not the only one who loves Creme de Corps, as \u201cRHONJ\u201d star Melissa Gorga told us it\u2019s her \u201cabsolute favorite.\u201d Lunya Washable Silk Short Pajamas While the comfy Lunya pants from Oprah\u2019s most recent \u201cFavorite Things\u201d list aren\u2019t on sale, this silk PJ set is just as luxe. Barefoot Dreams CozyChic Short Robe Dreaming of a spa-like robe? Oprah\u2019s also spotlighted Barefoot Dreams\u2019 super-soft loungewear several times over the years.

Wellness and beauty sponsored posts may be overflowing your screen. From soul-searching courses and yoga exercises for your face to spirulina supplements, influencers are creating content to promote wellness that once took months to produce. New tools and gadgets have enabled influencers to bring products to life in mere minutes, making the once impossible seem effortless. Just as Edward Bernays, the founding father of PR, made smoking desirable by featuring gorgeous women smoking a cigarette, today, many influencers are inspiring people to rethink how they approach their health. With an estimated 129 million people in the U.S. having chronic health issues, influencers are making wellness messages desirable in many shapes and forms, like broadcasting from doctors' offices in real time while getting procedures. The wellness industry is set to grow from $5.6 trillion in 2023 to over $8 trillion globally by 2027, and influencers are at the forefront of this movement. Their ability to inspire a genuine desire for wellness, youthful looks, radiant skin and sustainability is moving the wellness industry from lecturing about wellness to inspiring consumers to want it. Create authentic relationships and campaigns with influencers. My company has been at the forefront of influencer marketing, and over the years, we learned that the most authentic campaigns are possible when an influencer is using a product and connects with a mission and values of the brand. MORE FOR YOU NYT \u2018Strands\u2019 Hints, Spangram And Answers For Tuesday, July 9th WWE Raw Results, Winners And Grades As Rhea Ripley Returns The Best Brewery In The U.S.\u2014According To The U.S. Open Beer Championship Here is our checklist to identify the perfect match between the brands we represent and influencers we are looking for. \u2022 Consider values. Look for influencers whose values align with a brand. This means that the influencer will be passionate about sharing why they love the brand but also align themselves with the team behind the company, including community engagement and beyond. \u2022 It's about relationships. When you find your \"golden influencers,\" nurture those relationships. Continuous engagement helps in creating trust and credibility. We enjoy collaborating with influencers over time\u2014cooking classes and events of any kind where an influencer shows up and acts as a brand ambassador are great examples. \u2022 They got this. When the influencer understands your brand, they can contribute beyond authentic content. We appreciate the feedback our influencers bring to the table as a result of interactions with their followers about the brand. We channel this input back to our clients to give them valuable market research. Influencers can help people learn about and appreciate other cultures. Influencers are leading the way beyond brand endorsements. The trust they cultivate with their followers position them as an authority. For example, in 2016, we created a campaign for brands from Taiwan, and we extended the campaign by bringing to life a sustainable pop-up store in Seattle. The pop-up store would not have been a success without influencers, who bridged Taiwanese culture and transformed our pop-up store into a vibrant cultural experience. Through an evocative music performance by renowned musicians with international following and baking and bubble tea demos with a celebrity chef and best-selling author, visitors discovered and engaged with Taiwanese lifestyle products. When introducing new products to the U.S. market from other countries, consider following these tips. \u2022 Make it delicious. Conversations start at a dinner table, and so can discovery. We've found success pairing marketing of unfamiliar brands with culinary discoveries to introduce people to another culture through food and flavors. \u2022 Engage through stories. Use storytelling to connect cultural elements with the brand\u2019s message. Influencers can share personal stories or travel experiences. \u2022 Include interactive elements. Incorporate interactive elements such as live demos or interactive exhibits to create immersive experiences. Consider influencers for roles as cause ambassadors. Charities are also embracing relationships with influencers to energize their communities and extend their voice to new members. A few years ago, we had the opportunity to collaborate with an organization bringing together thought leaders supporting the eradication of Polio. I experienced firsthand how a charitable cause can go viral with a campaign through storytelling. Influencers have important voices and can endorse and support a charitable cause by sharing their personal stories of how a charity played a big part in their lives. From fundraising to attracting volunteers, influencers can lead the way for your charity to create a meaningful impact and amplify your brand. Building trust for big and small brands requires three key elements. While listening to the giants of marketing at a conference in Miami, it became clear to me that whether you are managing any influencer marketing campaign or a med spa next door, it all comes down to the trust the influencer can evoke from their followers and back into your brand. The keys to building trust include: \u2022 Consistency: Ensure consistency in messaging and brand values across all influencer collaborations. \u2022 Transparency: Be transparent about your sponsorships and collaborations. Honesty builds credibility and trust with the audience. \u2022 Genuine endorsements: Work with influencers who genuinely use and believe in your product. Forced endorsements can be easily spotted and can damage trust. In influencers, we trust. Influencer marketing campaigns can drive higher conversion rates, with 37% of consumers trusting influencer recommendations over traditional advertising methods. Furthermore, businesses are experiencing a $5.2 ROI for every $1 invested in influencer marketing, and 86% of consumers have purchased a product online at least once a year after seeing it promoted by an influencer. Often, consumers are more likely to discover new products or brands through social media, making it a crucial platform for these initiatives. I have seen a transformation enabling niche startups in the wellness industry to launch brands in months and debut concepts at expos and trade shows. The speed to market and proof of concept is exponential, thanks to social media and influencers. Wellness is no longer a niche; it\u2019s a movement, and influencers are a huge part of it, making hard work seem seamless as they get procedures done on the screen to get your attention, while thinking about the next soundtrack to appeal to all of your senses.

        "text": "As India\u2019s prime minister, Narendra Modi, landed in Moscow on Monday, it was straight into the warm embrace of Vladimir Putin. Modi said the visit \u2013 his first since Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine \u2013 was to cement the \u201cbonds of friendship\u201d between the two countries, and later effusively described Russia as India\u2019s \u201call-weather friend and trusted ally\u201d. The India-Russia relationship runs deep, dating back to the cold war, and Russia has long been the largest supplier of arms to India. Since he was elected in 2014, Modi has built up a much-publicised rapport with Putin, the two leaders having had more than 20 meetings. However, Putin\u2019s decision to invade Ukraine in February 2022 put an unprecedented strain on their ties and forced India to tread a tricky path in balancing its relationships with both Putin and the west. India refused to join western countries in condemning Putin\u2019s invasion and abstained from all UN votes denouncing Russia. It also eagerly became the largest buyer of cheap Russian oil, still sending billions to the country\u2019s coffers, which was seen by some to undermine western sanction efforts. Nonetheless, India\u2019s displeasure with Putin\u2019s actions was not entirely concealed, with Modi stating that \u201cnow is not the era for war\u201d. The Indian prime minister\u2019s decision to strengthen his relationship with the western leaders who are Putin\u2019s biggest critics, including the US president, Joe Biden, and the French president, Emmanuel Macron, has been met frostily in the corridors of the Kremlin. Similarly, Putin\u2019s increasingly close ties with Beijing are viewed with great suspicion in New Delhi, where China is viewed as the greatest threat. But while the geopolitical landscape was markedly different from 2019, when Modi was last in Moscow, the leaders went to great pains to display their continued bonhomie over the two-day visit which ended on Tuesday night. As they greeted each other on Monday, Modi told Putin he was looking forward to their \u201cchit-chat\u201d. During a teatime tour around Putin\u2019s residence, Putin expressed his delight that his \u201cdear friend\u201d Modi had made the journey to Russia, saying he was \u201cvery happy\u201d to see him again. \u201cTo visit a friend at home is, of course, a great joy,\u201d Modi replied. The pair then jumped in a golf buggy driven by the Russian leader and whizzed off to view his collection of horses. Parallels with Putin\u2019s visit to North Korea a few weeks earlier, where he cruised the streets of Pyongyang at the wheel of a limousine laughing and joking alongside the supreme leader, Kim Jong-un, did not go unnoticed. Later on Monday night, Putin then hosted an informal \u201cspecial dinner\u201d for the Indian prime minister, an honour that the Kremlin emphasised was reserved for very few. The Kremlin had spoken gleefully of Modi\u2019s decision to make Russia among his first international trips after winning a third term in power in June. In a TV interview over the weekend, the Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said western leaders were \u201cjealous\u201d of the summit, adding: \u201cAnd they are not mistaken, there is something to attach great importance to.\u201d Indian officials were more reserved, however, with New Delhi emphasising that the visit, Modi\u2019s first in five years, was about bilateral relations, adding that India sought to \u201cplay a supportive role for a peaceful and stable region\u201d. On Tuesday\u2019s formal summit, Modi said he and Putin had discussed everything from new Indian embassies in Russia to increased cooperation on trade. Yet the complexities of India\u2019s diplomatic tightrope walk over Ukraine were also uncomfortably on display. Just a few hours before Modi touched down in Moscow, Russian air missiles struck Ukraine\u2019s largest children\u2019s hospital, among other civilian targets, killing dozens and prompting global condemnation. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, described it as \u201ca devastating blow to peace efforts to see the leader of the world\u2019s largest democracy hug the world\u2019s most bloody criminal in Moscow on such a day\u201d. The summit took also place on the same day that the Nato summit kicked off in Washington, where Biden and other leaders are expected to announce a historic defence package for Ukraine. Putin\u2019s war has also become an awkward domestic issue for Modi after it emerged that dozens, if not hundreds, of Indians have been recruited unknowingly or against their will to work for the Russian army on the frontlines in Ukraine, with at least two Indians killed in strikes. After the issue was raised in their informal chat, Putin promised Modi that all Indians would be discharged from the Russian military and sent home. At Monday night\u2019s dinner, Modi reportedly made his most direct appeal for Putin to end the war in Ukraine, telling the Russian president that \u201cthere is no solution on the battlefield\u201d. Yet up against Putin\u2019s megalomaniacal ambitions, few analysts believed Modi\u2019s words would have any sway.",

Beckinsale also wore a black hairpiece adorned with an oversized bow, which she explained in the video was a hair net while noting how some people \"get upset\" and don't think she's \"doing enough age-appropriate things.\" \"I thought I'd let them kick off their week with a little stab of joy, of me putting on a hair net,\" she said, adding later, \"So for those of you who are gonna get off on this, have a look, bitches.\" \"Let\u2019s have a toast for the douche bags / Let\u2019s have a toast for the a------- / Let\u2019s have a toast for the scumbags ????,\" she captioned the clip.

In recent years, Beckinsale has made oversize hair bows her trademark, despite criticism of the look. \"Please take that ridiculous bow off,\" one user commented on a carousel of videos shared last month, on June 17.

In response to another commenter who said the actress looked like \"a toddler in a pageant,\" she clapped back, \"Lucky old me.\" Beckinsale, who was recently hospitalized for an undisclosed health issue, opened up in a since-deleted Instagram post about the \"vicious\" bullying she faces and her \"severe anxiety\" around aging. \"Whatever someone looks like, accusing them constantly of things they haven\u2019t done, or being obsessed with youth when actually, currently I\u2019m obsessed with surviving loss, is bullying,\" she said, in part. \"Please stop now.\"",

        "text": "Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin Topline Shares of legacy Silicon Valley giant Intel rallied Tuesday to their highest level in months, bucking the multiyear trend of underperformance as investors favored Intel\u2019s rivals amid the artificial intelligence bonanza. After a brutal first half, Intel stock is on an upward trajectory. AFP via Getty Images Key Facts Intel stock rose 2% to over $35 shortly after market open, registering its highest share price since April 18, dipping to a milder 0.2% rise by midmorning. The gains came a day after the semiconductor chip maker\u2019s stock rose 6.2% Monday. Spurring the surge was a Monday note from Melius Research analyst Ben Reitzes, who predicted the \u201cunloved\u201d Intel stock may be in line for a \u201cseasonal bounce\u201d as part of a broader \u201ccatch-up trade\u201d for some under-performing stocks with \u201clower expectation\u201d in AI. Intel is now the third top-returning stock on the S&P 500 in July, with its 13% gain trailing only Tesla\u2019s 29% and glassmaker and unlikely AI darling Corning\u2019s 14%. Intel\u2019s recovery Tuesday was part of a broader chip rally, as the Philadelphia Stock Exchange's Semiconductor index (SOX) rose nearly 1%, with other major risers including Nvidia and Micron, shares of which both rose about 3%.

Contra Intel was the third-worst stock listed on the S&P during the first six months of 2024, and its share price remains down 32% year-to-date. Its stock has underperformed many of its high-tech peers this year and over the last several years. Intel\u2019s 10% 12-month and -33% three-year returns are far worse than Nvidia\u2019s (210%, 560%), Advanced Micro Devices\u2019 (58%, 96%), Broadcom\u2019s (112%, 296%), Micron\u2019s (122%, 74%) and the Nasdaq Composite index (36%, 28%). It\u2019s not just the abstract belief that Intel is less suited to pounce on the intense interest in generative AI, but it\u2019s also a long-term decline in earnings. Last year was Intel\u2019s worst year by revenue since 2013 and its worst year by net income since 2001. What To Watch For Intel will report quarterly results later this month. Average analyst forecasts predict the company will report a modest 0.2% increase in second-quarter revenues, a fraction of market dominator Nvidia\u2019s more than 100% top line growth last quarter.

        "text": "A newlywed couple experienced a real-life Wedding Crashers moment at their recent nuptials. According to a post shared on Reddit by the bride\u2019s brother, the newlyweds had \u201ca random couple\u201d show up uninvited to their wedding \u2014 and leave an unexpected gift for them. The post featured a photo of a greeting card opened to display a handwritten message inside, along with a $1 and $10 bill and a small pile of coins, which the OP explained totaled $11.54. The message read: \u201cCheers to a life filled with many special memories. We feel so blessed to have been witness to your beautiful wedding. We wish you all the best in life!\u201d The card was signed, \u201cLove, Uncle David and Aunt Nancy.\u201d The only problem? The newlyweds have no relatives with those names, according to the bride\u2019s brother, Ben Carroll, who spoke to Newsweek about the strange incident. Carroll told the outlet that he first noticed the crashers when he observed two \u201cdrunk\u201d people \u201cbeing thrown out\u201d of his sister\u2019s wedding reception in Virginia. \u201cAs I saw them being escorted from the bar to the door, I realized that I didn't recognize them,\u201d he recalled. \u201cNobody had any conversations with them that I know of at the wedding.\u201d He said the pair had been talking to other guests at the hotel venue earlier in the day, asking questions about his sister\u2019s wedding.

When the newlyweds later discovered the crashers\u2019 gift, \u201cthey instantly knew who it was,\" Carroll told Newsweek. \"They sent the photo [of the card and money] that I eventually posted to our combined (bride and groom side) group chat,\u201d he explained. \u201cAfter some disbelief and extra confirmation that there's no David or Nancy, the whole (newly joined) family was beside themselves with laughter.\" He said his sister wasn't at all upset by the situation. \"By the time she heard about the crashers, they'd already been removed, and she was laughing at the situation... mostly amused that she was throwing a wedding worth crashing,\" he explained. Carroll\u2019s Reddit post garnered more than 33,000 upvotes and hundreds of comments, with many people speculating that the couple might have a habit of crashing strangers\u2019 weddings. \u201cI wonder if they go around to weddings all over the place, slipping into receptions,\u201d one person wrote. Another commented, \u201cThe fact they HAD a wedding-themed card on them insinuates they planned this &/or do this regularly ?.\u201d Yet another person hinted that the couple may have been after the free food and drinks at the reception. \u201cDinner for two for less than $12. Not bad. They scored,\u201d they wrote, prompting someone else to chime in: \u201cNot to mention the open bar\u2026\u201d The PEOPLE Puzzler crossword is here! How quickly can you solve it? Play now! Others gave the crashers credit for at least acknowledging the newlyweds\u2019 hospitality by leaving them a small gift in return. \u201cRandom guests show up, AND they brought a card? Ngl [not gonna lie], this is one of the more wholesome wedding crasher stories I've read! Hope that nutty couple is well wherever they are!\u201d one Redditor wrote. As for Carroll\u2019s sister and her family, it seems they have no hard feelings toward their \u201cuncle\u201d and \u201caunt\u201d for crashing the wedding. In a comment on his Reddit post, Carroll wrote, \u201cDavid and Nancy, wherever you are, you provided us with a lifelong story and a core memory. Sorry you got kicked out. From the looks of it, you thoroughly enjoyed yourselves!\u201d",

        "text": "Donald Trump knows a thing or two about self-esteem. Speaking this week about whether or not his rival Joe Biden can survive as a presidential candidate in 2024, he cut to the point: \u201cHe\u2019s got an ego and he doesn\u2019t want to quit.\u201d If anything, that was a rare example of Trumpian understatement. The truth is Joe Biden has always had an extremely high opinion of himself. And today, as his faculties decline and a growing number of his fellow Democrats beg him to stand down, his ego remains the one aspect of himself to which he can cling. In fact, the only occasions now when Biden recovers some of his verbal fluency come when he starts bragging about how great he is. Introduced, correctly, as the \u201cpresumptive Democratic nominee\u201d, he began an interview on Monday by insisting: \u201cI\u2019m more than presumptive. I\u2019m gonna be the Democratic nominee.\u201d At the weekend, in his first interview since the now infamous debate, he waxed lyrical about his achievements. \u201cI\u2019m the guy who put Nato together,\u201d he said, whispering the hyperbole somewhat manically. \u201cI\u2019m the guy who shut Putin down \u2026 I don\u2019t think there is anyone who is more qualified to be president than me.\u201d Biden may not have much in common with Trump, yet the two men share an unshakeable faith that God put them on earth to be in the White House. Biden now says he\u2019ll only pull out if \u201cthe Lord Almighty comes down\u201d in order to tell him he can\u2019t defeat Trump. Democrats hope that they can convince him to pull out of the election by placating his vanity and comparing him to no less a man than George Washington, America\u2019s first president, who was willing to step aside for the greater good. But Biden seems utterly convinced that his special destiny is to be the man who defeats Donald Trump again in order to, as he puts it, \u201csave democracy.\u201d It\u2019s hard to reason with such thinking. Presidents tend to be vain, of course: you don\u2019t run to be leader of the free world because of an excess of humility. But Biden\u2019s egotism has long had a particularly prickly quality. Bullied as a child for his stammer, he often perceives disagreements as slights and is quick to anger as a result. When Barack Obama tapped him up to be his vice-president in 2008, he hesitated at first: he thought the role might be beneath him. \u201cI\u2019m not going to grovel to this guy. My manhood is non-negotiable,\u201d he once reportedly said during discussions of what his role as Obama\u2019s \u201cveep\u201d might entail. Many of the people who have worked with Biden are fiercely loyal and will defend him until his last breath. But not everyone feels the same way. Jeff Connaughton, a former Biden senate staffer, once described him as \u201can egomaniacal autocrat\u201d who was \u201cdetermined to manage his staff through fear.\u201d Today, the rumours in Washington suggest he has become increasingly impossible to deal with. His inner circle is becoming increasingly small. It now consists of his wife Jill, his close family, and a small team of long-term advisers. His closest aides, Anthony Bernal and Mike Donilon, are said to shield the President from unwanted news for fear of triggering his temper. Throughout his long career in politics, Biden has been successful at hiding his more unpleasant streak from the outside world. But he is a big show off, and his exaggerations often betray a certain arrogance. As a presidential candidate, he repeatedly claimed to have been at the heart of the civil-rights movement in the 1960s and 70s; and only backtracked under media scrutiny. Again similar to Trump, Biden likes to boast about his willingness to stand up to foreign leaders. One of his favourite anecdotes is how, as vice president, he squared up to Vladimir Putin in the Kremlin and said: \u201cMr Prime Minister, I\u2019m looking into your eyes and I don\u2019t think you have a soul.\u201d Does anybody believe that happened? Biden\u2019s intense faith in his own abilities still drives him today, even as Democratic bigwigs suggest it might be time finally for him to fall on his sword. In a letter to his fellow Democrats, released on Monday, he struck a typically defiant note as he called for all the speculation about his future to end. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be running if I did not absolutely believe I was the best person to beat Donald Trump,\u201d he wrote. His great problem, however, is that almost nobody now shares that confidence.",

This year marks the 70th anniversary of the iconic cocktail, so what better spirit to enjoy on the ocassion than the oldest rum crafted on the Island of Enchantment? \u201cThere are a few different claims about the origin of the pi\u00f1a colada. We know that it originated in Puerto Rico and is one of the most well-known rum-based cocktails,\u201d says Maggie Matias, Chief Commercial Officer for Ron del Barrilito, the oldest Puerto Rican rum brand still in production. \u201cThe renowned cocktail is Puerto Rico's national drink and was created in San Juan, so it has a deep history in our culture and goes beyond just savoring the mix of pineapple juice, coconut cream, and rum. For many visitors, a pi\u00f1a colada conjures images of vacation in Puerto Rico like the vast beaches, colorful sunsets, and lush palm trees,\u201d says Matias. Ron Del Barrilito is the oldest Puerto Rican rum still in production on the island. Ron Del Barrilito In 1880, Pedro Fern\u00e1ndez created the formula and process used to make Ron del Barrilito at his family estate, the historic Hacienda Santa Ana in Bayam\u00f3n. For nearly 150 years, Ron del Barrilito has been produced in the same manner, including the use of Oloroso sherry casks and naturally harvested rainwater.

The result: Ron del Barrilito Three Stars, a blend of rums between six to 10 years, that has become an icon of Puerto Rico.\u201d The brand\u2019s name pays homage to the way Don Pedro served the rum to his guests from a little barrel \u2014\u201cbarrilito\u201d in Spanish. The Hacienda\u2019s guests kept asking for more of that \u201cron del barrilito\u201d and the rest is history. It is not unusual that, when asking for a rum recommendation at bars in Puerto Rico today, most locals will mention Del Barrilito. It\u2019s an island staple, found at bars large and small for crafting any classic rum cocktail. The \"barrilito\" from which Don Pedro Fern\u00e1ndez served rum to his guests. Claudia Alarc\u00f3n The Three Stars formula was the only one produced for more than half a century. In 2018 the brand unveiled the first new products in almost 80 years: Four Stars (aged up to 20 years) and Five Stars (aged up to 35 years) which are limited edition denominations, made with the same process but incorporating older rums into the blends. Ron del Barrilito is still produced at the beautiful Hacienda Santa Ana, prioritizing sustainable practices. They collect rainwater that falls across the property to use in the production of their award-winning rum. The rainwater flows into pre-seed tanks that filter out any matter or particles and they use a pump outlet, sand filter, carbon filter, and finally a 5.0-micron lenticular filter to clear out any impurities. They also cultivate fruit trees on the property, collecting and donating the ripe fruit to local shelters and charitable organizations. Having started with a cork top and shifted to a plastic screwcap, the brand recently brought back the cork tops as sustainable cork production is better for the environment. Many wonderful artifacts are still found at the Hacienda, such as this car used to deliver Del ... [+] Barrilito in the area.

The trailer for the fourth and final season of The Umbrella Academy premiered on Tuesday, July 9, and it's almost time for the Hargreeves siblings' final mission. The final season will see the family band together \u2014 along with their father, billionaire industrialist Sir Reginald Hargreeves (Colm Feore), who was previously believed to be dead \u2014 to save the world and Ben (Justin H. Min). As the trailer begins, Ben gets a call from Viktor (Elliot Page), who warns him: \"There's something happening to you and it's only gonna get worse. You're on pace to end the world in about 48 hours.\" \"24 actually,\" their father corrects. At the same time, though, it seems like newcomers Drs. Gene (Nick Offerman) and Jean Thibedeau (Megan Mullally) are coming to the same conclusions about Ben. \"That tentacle boy is the key to understanding all the timelines,\" Gene tells his wife. This time, though, as Klaus (Robert Sheehan) sarcastically reveals \u2014 \"So the world's ending again, huh? God, that's tragic\" \u2014 the family must band together to save one of their own. \"We need to fix this,\" Number Five (Aidan Gallagher) tells his siblings. \"Okay, can anyone of you remember how Ben actually died?\" \"Ben died because we failed as a team,\" Allison (Emmy Raver-Lampman) and Luther (Tom Hopper) say at the same time, before Luther seems to have a lightbulb moment that might just hold the key to fixing it all. As the trailer concludes, another new face is introduced, Sy Grossman (David Cross), who declares: \"I wouldn't miss what's coming for the world.\" According to the official synopsis, the final season of the Netflix hit \u2014 which is based on the comic book series of the same name \u2014 picks up with the Hargreeves siblings \"scattered after the climactic showdown at the Hotel Oblivion led to a complete reset of their timeline.\" \"Stripped of their powers, each is left to fend for themselves and find a new normal \u2014 with wildly varying degrees of success. Yet the trappings of their uncanny new world prove too hard to ignore for very long.\" With their father alive, they've got even more on their plate as he's \"stepped out of the shadows and into the public eye, overseeing a powerful and nefarious business empire.\" This occurs all while there's a \"mysterious association known as The Keepers hold[ing] clandestine meetings believing the reality they\u2019re living in is a lie and a great reckoning is coming.\" \"As these strange new forces conspire around them, the Umbrella Academy must come together one last time \u2014 and risk upsetting the shaky peace they\u2019ve all endured so much to secure \u2014 to finally set things right.\" Never miss a story \u2014 sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer\u200b\u200b, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.

Connor Patterson didn't answer his phone again \u2014 but he did learn he and his doctor have similar tastes in music. The medical professional wrote Patterson to note his attempt to get in touch and to share his appreciation for Patterson's hilarious voicemail greeting \u2014 an old-school recording of Britney Spears. The 26-year-old tells PEOPLE he set the \"vintage\" audio to answer missed calls back when he was a sophomore in high school, and he's kept it ever since. Patterson posted a TikTok about the interaction with his doctor and shared the full answering message, which begins with a soundbite from Spears' 1999 hit single \"...Baby One More Time.\" Never miss a story \u2014 sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from juicy celebrity news to compelling human interest stories. The singer's voice then addresses the caller, saying, \"Hi, this is Britney Spears and sometimes my friend can't come to the phone, and this is one of those times. So leave a message at the beep, and baby, they'll call you back one more time. And thanks for calling!\" The TikTok also features a screenshot of Patterson's doctor's response, which simply reads, \"Just called you (incredible voicemail btw).\" Patterson admits that he was initially a little embarrassed to know Spears greeted his doctor on the phone, but the Chicago resident also understood his doctor's appreciation was genuine. \"He got a kick out of it too ... I think he appreciates it,\" says Patterson. \"I'm also assuming as a gay male, he probably loves her too. So I think he loved it all.\" The TikTok creator says that the doctor similarly appreciates how much social media users loved their interaction, which has reached 3.9 million views and over 419,000 likes since Patterson posted it in May. \"I actually sent him a message being like, 'Hey, just letting you know I screenshotted your message and I put it on TikTok,' \" Patterson recalls. \"He was like, 'That's hilarious. I can't believe this happened.' It just happened overnight, really.\" Despite Spears' longtime presence on Patterson's phone, he tells PEOPLE that he often forgets that her voice greets callers when they can't reach him. \"I never really answer my phone unless I'm expecting a call or if it's a name I remember. So a lot of the times I just let it go to voicemail and then someone makes a comment on it,\" the professional event coordinator explains. \"I'm like, 'Oh s---, that's still my voicemail,' and then I'm just like, 'Whatever, it's funny.' \" Spears clearly sounds younger in her message, but Patterson adds that the audio quality is also a sign of the time when he set it as his voicemail. He remembers holding his cellphone up to a computer to capture the sound directly from a YouTube video. \"It was just a straight-up recording, and that's why it sounds so muffled. I must've been on my iPhone 4 or something like that,\" he says. While the sound quality isn't totally up to today's standards, Patterson says he has no plans to replace his voicemail greeting. \"Oh my God, I'm going to keep it forever,\" he tells PEOPLE, adding that he now gets calls from friends who aren't even looking to have a conversation: \"Sometimes people will tell me, 'Oh, I'm going to call you, but don't answer it because I need to show someone your voicemail,' \" says Patterson.",

As the Forrest Gump actor turned 68 on Tuesday, July 9, his actress wife of 36 years posted a lengthy tribute on Instagram, which she presented alongside a seemingly recent photo of Hanks standing in front of an impressive record collection and record player. \"??? Happy Birthday to my love! ???,\" Wilson, 67, began her caption. \"You made the world a better place the day you were born. You bring joy wherever you go.\" \"You are the bringer of laughs, a lover of vehicles, or pretty much anything, shaped like a round bath tub,\" she continued. \"The bookshelves in our house shout from their bindings your love of history and the unexpectedly romantic Maeve Binchy.\" Never miss a story \u2014 sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from juicy celebrity news to compelling human-interest stories. \"You get as much pleasure from recording your radio show @bossradio66 as you do from listening to any kind of surf music on vinyl,\" Wilson went on. \"@tcm is your go to channel any time of day or night. Your patience for our kids harassing you about your ignorance of pop culture is admirable.\" She concluded, \"We love you. I love you. So much and every day. ???\" Julia Roberts, who starred with Hanks in Charlie Wilson's War (2007) and Larry Crowne (2011), was among those who left sweet messages in Wilson's comments section. \"Yes! Happy Birthday Tom,\" wrote Roberts, 56. \"So happy you were born. \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\" Wilson and Hanks made their red-carpet debut as a couple in 1986, and tied the knot in 1988. They share sons Chet Hanks, 33, and Truman Hanks, 28, in addition to Hanks' kids from his first marriage: Colin Hanks, 46, and Elizabeth Hanks, 42. The couple marked their 36th wedding anniversary on April 30, with the actor captioning a photo of himself and his wife, \"1988? April 30th? Big Doings. The Wilson & Hanks couple became Wife & Husband. 36 years! Nothing but Love since \u2026 Hanx.\" Wilson, meanwhile, shared a carousel of photos featuring the pair posing together in a variety of scenarios, including on a ski trip, at Egypt's Great Sphinx of Giza and in a recording studio. In one photo, Hanks amusingly placed his head on Wilson's shoulder, while the final picture showed them laughing together inside a car. \"36th anniversary! April 30, 1988,\" the Asteroid City actress captioned her post, before quoting \"Rabbi Ben Ezra\" by poet Robert Browning: \u201cGrow old along with me; the best is yet to be.\"",

        "text": "The far right has been on the rise across Europe, and former President Donald Trump has seen his poll numbers tick up as European leaders prepare to gather in Washington, D.C., for the NATO summit, where they'll be working to safeguard their commitment to Ukraine. The exact messaging out of NATO and President Biden will be closely monitored by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who last year criticized the group's joint statement as \"unprecedented and absurd,\" for its lack of a concrete timeline for Ukraine's admission to the alliance. Biden administration officials, in particular, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Secretary of State Antony Blinken, have said this summit, which is taking place on the 75th anniversary of NATO's founding, will be a \"bridge\" to eventual NATO membership for Ukraine, which President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has sought. What they did not say was that if Trump wins the presidency, that bridge could fall.\"Sure there's a bridge, but is there really going to be NATO membership for Ukraine on the other side of the bridge? We don't know,\" says James Goldgeier, a professor of international relations at American University.After Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, NATO sent military equipment to Ukraine and expanded the alliance to include both Finland and Sweden. One of the major obstacles to bringing Ukraine into NATO is the requirement under Article 5 that any member of the alliance, including the U.S., must send its troops to defend an attack on another NATO member. \"Ukraine is going to come out of this war having a very powerful army \u2013 battle-tested army, we should want that army connected to NATO,\" says Karen Donfried, senior fellow at the Harvard Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs and former assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian Affairs.NATO allies have agreed to 40 billion euros in funding Ukraine in the next year, according to Reuters. NATO also plans to set up a new command structure for training and assisting Ukraine that will largely eventually take over the responsibilities that the U.S.-led Ukraine Defense Contact Group has executed for the past two years. NATO troops would not go into Ukraine for training, but instead would be trained in NATO countries.Some analysts have seen these steps as an effort to \"Trump-proof\" NATO. President Trump has sent mixed signals about what he would do with the U.S. involvement in NATO \u2014 and Ukraine. He previously said he would encourage Russia to do \"whatever the hell they want\" to any NATO member country that does not meet spending guidelines on defense. \"I don't think there's such a thing as Trump-proofing \u2014 or presidential proofing in general,\" says Goldgeier. \"The president of the United States is extremely powerful in the U.S system and really is very unconstrained in terms of foreign policy.\"Congress has passed legislation to keep Trump from walking away from the alliance: in its defense bill last year, lawmakers included a provision that prohibits a president from withdrawing the U.S. from NATO without approval by a two-thirds majority in the Senate or a separate act of Congress.The June European parliamentary elections, often seen as a protest vote by politicians, showed strong support for far-right parties in France, Germany and Italy. French President Emmanuel Macron, stunned by the results, challenged his people to empower the far right, dissolving his parliament and calling for a snap election. The result of the first round of votes found the right's National Rally party winning by nearly a third of the vote, but in the end, a coalition of the far left and center right came together to stop the right from winning a majority.Marine Le Pen, the leader of the National Rally party, has in the past advocated removing French troops from NATO's integrated military command. But recently, the far-right party seemed to moderate its stance, quietly removing this position from the defense policy description on its website, along with a section that proposed deepening diplomatic ties with Russia, according to POLITICO Europe. Meanwhile, Hungary is taking control of the rotating presidency of the Council of the European Union and it's coming into power with a slogan that has a familiar ring to it \u2013 \"Make Europe Great Again.\" Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, whose country is a NATO member, met with Russian President Vladimir Putin last week in Moscow to discuss a peace settlement in Ukraine, sparking disapproval from both Ukraine and NATO members. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said Sunday on CBS News' \"Face the Nation\" that Orban's trip doesn't change NATO's position on assistance to Ukraine.Generally, the platforms of populist parties tend to advocate for a departure from international institutions. But the far-right parties in Europe are not monolithic on the topic of defense policy, particularly in the context of a ground war in Europe. \"We know that LePen in France is more sympathetic to Russia. But then you have someone like Meloni in Italy, who's very popular in Italy right now, and she has had a very stiff spine in terms of supporting Ukraine in this war,\" Donfried said. \"So it's hard to generalize on that issue about the far right because Russia is one of the issues that divides the far right in Europe.\"The most important goal at this summit should be to show cohesion amongst the allies, said Donfried. But even with the rise of the far right in European parliamentary elections, the center appeared to hold \u2014 the largest political groupings in the European Union parliament will be the center left and center right. Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski, in a conversation with Foreign Policy, argued that while military deterrence is a costly endeavor, it is far cheaper than waging war. Sikorski gave voice to the perspective of many former Soviet bloc countries that fear that if Ukraine falls, Russian President Vladimir Putin could invade them next.\"It feels far away to us Americans, but for any NATO ally bordering Ukraine, this is so real,\" said Donfried.

        "text": "In The Boyfriend, nine men live in a house called \u201cThe Green Room\u201d for a month, with the intention that the housemates will find love with at least one fellow housemate. At the very least, bonds will be formed towards lifetime close friendships. The series is shot in Japan, a country that is decidedly behind the curve when it comes to LGBTQIA+ rights. THE BOYFRIEND: STREAM IT OR SKIP IT? Opening Shot: Scenes from Season 1 of The Boyfriend. The Gist: The first five housemates move in the first day: Dai, the youngest but boldest of the group; Gensei, a hair and makeup artist from Taiwan; Ryota, a model; Shun, an artist who is the most objectively good looking but the most negative; and Taheon, a designer from Korea. Meanwhile, in East Asian reality show tradition, five hosts watch and observe: Yoshimi Tokui, Chiaki Horan, MEGUMI, Thelma Ayoama and Durian Lollobrigida. The new housemates receive a message on a tablet: They\u2019re told that they\u2019ll be working in a coffee truck together, keeping all proceeds, in order to foster a bond. They will be taking a barista class the next day and are tasked with coming up with a name. They eventually decide on Brewtiful U. The tablet also tells them that another cast member is arriving. That\u2019s Katzuto, who is a chef. After he cooks a great meal for the housemates, the group is told that they can write an anonymous letter to one person they\u2019d like to get to know better and put it in the box outside the person\u2019s room. The next morning, some housemates get one notes, some multiple notes, others none. On the third night, they\u2019re told to go to a club to meet the seventh cast member: Usak, one of the most famous \u201cgo-go biys\u201d in Japan. This comes right after Dai reveals to Shun that he likes him, but after Dai goes gaga over Usak, Shun feels that things have changed. What Shows Will It Remind You Of? The low-key nature of The Boyfriend reminds us of Terrace House, which is produced by the same company. Our Take: Netflix is making a big publicity push for The Boyfriend, and for good reason: It\u2019s a same-sex dating show coming from a country that is not known for its record on LGBTQIA+ rights. There is no same-sex marriage in Japan, and there are few openly-gay celebrities. What The Boyfriend tries to accomplish is to show relationships between men in Japan\u2019s gay community in a normalized light. And they\u2019ve picked a good cast to do just that. We\u2019ve seen the low-key, somewhat chaste vibe in dating shows from this region before, like the Japanese version of Love Is Blind. Producers of shows with this tone aren\u2019t trying to be scandalous; they want to show genuine friendships and relationships in their beginning stages. There will likely be some conflict here and there, and there is some producer manipulation, but it seems that the producers aren\u2019t trying to goose the drama too much here, which is refreshing. The cast members are all looking for relationships, ones they hope will last a lifetime. A couple of them are bisexual, which, according to drag queen host Durian Lollobrigida is something that men who are bi sometimes don\u2019t admit to among their gay friends. There seems to be a degree of openness among the cast, even if they all seem pretty shy at first. But they all seem like they sincerely are there to find love. The hosts always add some levity and perspective to what can sometimes be some draggy early episodes. We already mentioned Lollobrigida, but all five of them are enthusiastically making similar observations that the viewers at home might. It\u2019s a device we wish was used more in American reality shows. Sex and Skin: Well, other than some ab-and-pec shows on the beach or at the club, there isn\u2019t all that much skin and absolutely no sex. Parting Shot: The hosts see the annoyed look on Shun\u2019s face and they cheer for the drama that might ensue. Sleeper Star: Speaking of Shun, the man needs a little therapy to get him to build up some self-esteem. Maybe at some point, he\u2019ll reveal some inner secrets that will explain why he thinks so little of himself. Most Pilot-y Line: How do you play Rock, Paper Scissors among six people? That\u2019s what the roommates used to determine who will reveal who liked whom. Our Call: STREAM IT. The Boyfriend is a fascinating watch, but not just because it\u2019s a social experiment in same-sex relationships from a company that doesn\u2019t tend to do shows about them. But it\u2019s also a good example of a dating show that can be genuine about how relationships form and are maintained.

Applegate, 52, revealed that she's working on a memoir while chatting with her Anchorman costar, Will Ferrell, on the Tuesday, July 9 episode of her and Jamie-Lynn Sigler's MeSsy podcast. July 9 is the 20th anniversary of Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy. The Dead to Me star made the surprise reveal as Ferrell, 56, discussed his beloved 2000 Saturday Night Live sketch \"More Cowbell,\" which featured the likes of Christopher Walken and Jimmy Fallon. \"I've watched Saturday Night Live since I was little, which I probably shouldn't have been watching, but I was raised by Nancy [Priddy],\" she said before taking a pause and saying with a slight chuckle, \"It's gonna be in the book.\" After Ferrell advised her to \"wait for the book,\" Applegate added, \"Oh yeah, no, I'm writing it right now.\" and went on to praise the SNL skit. \"I just think like, I don't think there are many, I could name like five sketches that have, like, made me crack up over and over and over again,\" she told Ferrell. \"And I'd say out of those, you're in most of them, obviously.

        "text": "WASHINGTON -- Leaders of NATO countries will open their annual summit on July 9 in Washington to discuss ways to bolster the alliance's defense capabilities and support Ukraine against the backdrop of political uncertainty in the host country and Russia's intense bombing of Ukraine. NATO is expected to announce plans for European members to boost spending on weapons and ammunition procurement following years of underinvestment as well as a 40 billion-euro ($43 billion) aid package for Ukraine. The agenda of the three-day summit, which will mark NATO's 75th anniversary, will be partially overshadowed by concerns about U.S. President Joe Biden's age and ability to lead after his chances of winning reelection this November took a hit following his dismal debate performance against Republican contender Donald Trump last month. Support and aid to Ukraine is likely to take on even greater immediacy at the summit following one of the worst Russian air attacks on the country since the Kremlin launched the full-scale invasion in February 2022. The barrage of missiles fired across Ukraine on July 8 struck several civilian facilities, including Kyiv's Okhmatdyt Children's Hospital, killing at least 41 people in total and injuring scores more in what Biden called a \"horrific reminder of Russia's brutality.\" Michael Carpenter, senior director for NATO at the National Security Council, told reporters on July 8 that the allies will announce new measures to bolster Ukraine's security, including air defense and F-16 fighter jets, but he did not give any details. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has for months pleaded with NATO members for more air defense, especially the U.S.-made Patriot missile system, to defend its troops, cities, and infrastructure against large-scale Russian bombing campaigns. The alliance will also announce a new NATO military command in Germany to coordinate the training and equipping of Ukrainian troops and station a senior NATO representative in Kyiv. However, the summit will not extend an invitation for Ukraine to join the alliance. Carpenter said there was still no consensus on the issue among the 32 allies. The NATO communique is expected to say that Ukraine belongs in the alliance without giving a time frame for when it will join. NATO members also couldn't agree on a multiyear military aid package for Ukraine that outgoing Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg had proposed. Instead, NATO will announce a one-year, 40 billion-euro package. Biden and Zelenskiy will meet on July 11 and be joined by the leaders of about two dozen other countries that have signed bilateral security agreements with Ukraine. Biden last month signed a 10-year agreement that calls on the United States, among other things, to help bolster Ukraine's military-industrial complex through co-production and joint ventures with U.S. industry. The expected announcements have disappointed some Western supporters of Ukraine who want greater aid and a clearer path into NATO. \"I don't see this summit doing much for Ukraine at all,\" Kurt Volker, who served as U.S. ambassador to NATO in 2008-09 and former special envoy to Ukraine in 2017-19, told the Center for a New American Security earlier this month. But Carpenter said the commitments made to Ukraine during the summit will show that Russian President Vladimir Putin's strategy of outlasting the alliance won't work. NATO unity on Ukraine, however, will be challenged at the summit by Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, whose pro-Russian views have irked the alliance. Orban, who just took over the rotating presidency of the EU, flew to Moscow last week without informing the bloc ahead of time to discuss an end to the war with Putin. The trip was denounced by Zelenskiy, the EU, and the Biden administration. NATO Spending Defense spending by NATO members will be another hot topic at the summit. NATO members committed a decade ago to reach a defense spending target of at least 2 percent of gross national product by 2024. Stoltenberg said that 23 of the alliance's 32 members will meet that target this year. \"One of the things you'll see at the summit, certainly behind closed doors, is that there'll be a lot of allies holding each other's feet to the fire in terms of defense spending commitments,\" Carpenter said. U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson (Republican-Louisiana), a Trump ally, said on July 8 that Republicans \"celebrate the peace and stability that NATO has secured...but we also believe that NATO needs to be doing more.\" \u201cEveryone cannot ride along on the coattails of America. And Donald Trump says this as bluntly as anyone. It\u2019s just right and fair for us to demand that others do their part,\u201d he said. The United States accounts for 68 percent of NATO defense spending. Some Western officials say 2 percent should be a floor, not a ceiling, and that NATO members should be spending 2.5 percent or more amid growing threats from Russia, China, and Iran. \"If we look into the future, and we look into fully resourcing our defense plans and preparing for all possible contingency, this will require for a number of countries to go beyond 2 percent,\" Benedetta Berti, head of policy planning in the office of the NATO secretary-general. Johnson, who spoke at the Hudson Institute, a Washington think tank, said Republicans were pushing for a \"self-reliant European defense industrial base.\" Trump harangued NATO allies when he was president for not meeting their spending commitments, threatening at one point to withdraw the United States from the alliance. Biden's poor debate performance and the specter of another Trump presidency has many European allies worried. But National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said the White House had not picked up any signed from allies that they need to \"be reassured of American leadership and President Biden's commitments.\" Strengthening ties with Asian partners to contain China will be another topic at the summit. NATO allies will be joined by the leaders of four Asian countries, including Japan, South Korea, Australia, and New Zealand. NATO members have criticized China for supplying Russia with electronics used in weapons production. \"The global threats and challenges we face, including from authoritarian actors and terrorist organizations, are all inextricably linked,\" Carpenter said. For Stoltenberg, the summit is expected to be his last major event before he departs the alliance on October 1. He will be replaced by Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte.

They would do it again in a heartbeat, though.\"We would definitely do it again because it was so funny,\" Roberts said. \"My friend Mia always says, 'It's only embarrassing if you make it embarrassing.'

[+] High-Level Meeting on Global AI Governance at Shanghai World Expo Exhibition and Convention Center on July 6, 2024 in Shanghai, China. (Photo by Tang Yanjun/China News Service/VCG via Getty Images) China News Service via Getty Images China doesn\u2019t need the most advanced chips to take a leading role in global AI development, Zhang Ping\u2019an, CEO of Huawei Cloud, said at the World AI Conference held in Shanghai last week. Based on the technologies exhibited at the Conference, major players in the country\u2019s AI industry may be attempting to draw attention away from China\u2019s chip shortages and toward its advancements in a quintessential sci-fi form: humanoid robots. According to Huawei\u2019s Zhang, accepting the premise that advanced chips are the only path to AI leadership amounts to a de facto embrace of defeat. \"If we believe that not having the most advanced AI chips means we will be unable to lead in AI, then we need to abandon this viewpoint,\" he said. While banned chips can be found in places like Shenzhen\u2019s Huaqiangbei electronics market, they are rare and expensive. As the United States continues to tighten its controls on chip exports to China, it makes sense that top tech executives would try to find an effective spin. In lieu of a real solution to the chip shortage, the Conference championed Chinese-made robots. In its coverage of the event, one Chinese media headline asked whether robots are \u201cmore promising\u201d than large language models. The article quotes an executive from Chinese tech company Moore Threads who made the intuitive yet compelling case that since so much information is nonverbal, large language models are limited in ways fully enabled humanoid robots \u2013 equipped with synthetic eyes, ears, mouths, and limbs \u2013 wouldn\u2019t be. Creating robot brains that do not rely on LLMs may result in what he called \u201can unexpectedly intelligent entity.\u201d MORE FOR YOU NYT \u2018Strands\u2019 Hints, Spangram And Answers For Tuesday, July 9th WWE Raw Results, Winners And Grades As Rhea Ripley Returns The Best Brewery In The U.S.\u2014According To The U.S. Open Beer Championship But the article also points out that designing hardware that can enable robot coordination \u2013 in addition to and in sync with their software capabilities \u2013 is a difficult goal that researchers are still working toward. In that context, for robot enthusiasts, every advancement is worth celebrating. The World AI Conference tapped into that excitement, showcasing 18 mostly Chinese-made humanoid robots from companies including Fourier, Tlibot, Dataa Robotics, Robotera, Leju Robot, Shanghai Kepler Robot and Ti5 Robot. Regulation, in addition to innovation, was also on display. A group representing industrial, legal, and technical committees released \u201cGuidelines for the Governance of Humanoid Robots.\u201d The guidelines are designed to ensure robots do no harm and provide commercial value in line with \u201chuman moral values.\u201d Yet the Conference was also host to companies that have business operations outside Shanghai\u2019s regulatory jurisdiction. Tesla was one of very few American firms to be featured; it brought the second generation model of its robot, Optimus (though the robot was kept behind glass and didn\u2019t interact with attendees). In April, Tesla CEO Elon Musk told investors Optimus would be ready for use in Tesla factories in 2025.

(Photo by AFP) / China OUT (Photo by STR/AFP via Getty Images) AFP via Getty Images From robots to EVs, Tesla has enjoyed a degree of special treatment in China \u2013 possible due to the \u201csymbiotic relationship\u201d that has arguably developed between the company and the country in recent years. Just last week, Tesla was included on a list of approved companies for government procurement by the Jiangsu provincial government, partly in recognition of its manufacturing operations within China. Despite the apparent faith Chinese regulators have in Musk, their ultimate aim is to promote domestic companies. Their objective of achieving technological self reliance hinges on homegrown industry. Humanoid robots are an integral part of that larger plan. Last year, the Ministry of Industry and Informatization Technology (MIIT) released guiding opinions on developing them, emphasizing manufacturing applications. More recently, on July 5, Premier Li Qiang presided over a State Council meeting focused on speeding up the digital transformation of China\u2019s manufacturing sector. He said the industry regulator will focus on \u201cspecialized and innovative small and medium-sized enterprises.\u201d He added that it will \u201cgive priority to promoting the digital transformation of equipment manufacturing enterprises.\u201d China\u2019s leaders are heavily invested in applying advanced technologies to the country\u2019s industrial base. They see manufacturing as the area with the most immediate commercial viability. Using AI to generate videos is a fun fictional exercise, but it does nothing to advance China\u2019s long-term economic development and, possibly as a result, domestic and international political security. Plus, regulating AIGC in China comes with a heavy censorship burden. Ideally, robotic factory workers will not require ideological supervision. But if their \u201cintelligence\u201d reaches the levels companies are hoping for, they eventually might. Follow me on Twitter or LinkedIn.

In the July 9 episode of the MeSsy podcast, Ferrell, 56, reunited with his Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgandy costar, 52, to celebrate the movie's 20th anniversary. During the episode, Ferrell recalled to host Jamie Lynn Sigler how he thought Applegate assumed he had marital issues with his wife Viveca Ferrell. Will jumped right into reminiscing, asking Applegate if she recalled how she thought he \"was having marriage problems\" during Anchorman's production. \"When we were shooting the movie, we would go out a lot socially,\" he said, while Applegate started laughing. \"We would all go out as a group, like, on the weekends or whatever, grab a dinner. And, I was like oh great, let's do it!\" However, Viveca, 55, was constantly unavailable, which appeared suspicious. \"And you were like what's going on?\" Will continued, adding that Applegate \"verbalized it later\" and was asking why his wife wasn't coming out with everyone. As it turns out, Viveca had a pretty good reason for canceling. \"The reason was she wasn't feeling good because she was pregnant with Magnus.\" The couple was finally ready to share the happy news halfway through filming. \"'I knew something was up!'\" Will recalled his costar saying. Applegate responded, \"I remember that you guys had something you weren't sharing yet.\" Never miss a story \u2014 sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer\u200b\u200b, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories. She then added that Will and his wife are \"couple goals across the board,\" and that they are \"a force to be reckoned with.\" Will said that he and Viveca met in 1991, with the couple tying the knot in August 2000. They will be celebrating 24 years of marriage next month. He told PEOPLE in 2006 about their awkward proposal. \"It started serious but ended up comedic,\" the Elf actor said at the time. \"I took her to this beach where we had had one of our first dates. She wanted none of it. She was, like, 'The beach is creepy at night.' I was, like, 'Shut up, this is supposed to be really romantic.' \" The PEOPLE Puzzler crossword is here! How quickly can you solve it? Play now! Viveca's comment threw off Will in the moment. \"I was trying to think of what I was going to say and it just turned into, 'So I, uh, really like you and, uh, anyway \u2026' Then I went down to a knee \u2014 at least I think I did \u2014 and proposed,\" the comedian recalled. \"So it was kind of funny, but not on purpose.\" The couple share three sons: Magnus, 20, Mattias, 17, and Axel, 14.",

Owens has a sickle cell trait that makes him oxygen-deficient and in need of added hydration when he's playing, which is where their drinks come in. \"Basically, when you're at an oxygen deficiency you're more cramp-prone. And being in the NFL, you have to be available as a starter. You can't be on the sideline and be missing time,\" he tells PEOPLE. \"So I really had to take my hydration serious and make sure that I was putting the right things in my body that just would continue to let me perform.\" But between his practices, the couple will unite in Paris \u2014 it will be the football player\u2019s first visit! \u2014 where watching Biles compete will take precedence.

(AP) \u2014 Alec Baldwin\u2019s trial in the shooting of a cinematographer is set to begin Tuesday with the selection of jurors who will be tasked with deciding whether the actor is guilty of involuntary manslaughter. Getting chosen to serve in a trial of such a major star accused of such a major crime would be unusual even in Los Angeles or Baldwin\u2019s hometown of New York. But it will be essentially an unheard-of experience for those who are picked as jurors in Santa Fe, New Mexico, though the state has increasingly become a hub of Hollywood production in recent years. Baldwin and his wife Hilaria arrived at the courthouse Tuesday with at least one of their youngest children. The couple have several children, with the youngest set to turn 2 in September. Baldwin, 66, could get up to 18 months in prison if jurors unanimously decide he committed the felony when a revolver he was pointing at cinematographer Halyna Hutchins went off, killing her and wounding director Joel Souza during a rehearsal for the Western film \u201cRust\u201d in October 2021 at Bonanza Creek Ranch, some 18 miles (29 kilometers) from where the trial is being held. Baldwin has said the gun fired accidentally after he followed instructions to point it toward Hutchins, who was behind the camera. Unaware the gun contained a live round, Baldwin said he pulled back the hammer \u2014 not the trigger \u2014 and it fired. The star of \u201c30 Rock\u201d and \u201cThe Hunt for Red October\u201d made his first appearance in the courtroom on Monday, when Judge Mary Marlowe Summer, in a significant victory for the defense, ruled at a pretrial hearing that Baldwin\u2019s role as a co-producer on \u201cRust\u201d isn\u2019t relevant to the trial. The judge has said that the special circumstances of a celebrity trial shouldn\u2019t keep jury selection from moving quickly, and that opening statements should begin Wednesday. \u201cI\u2019m not worried about being able to pick a jury in one day,\u201d Marlowe Summer said. \u201cI think we\u2019re going to pick a jury by the afternoon.\u201d Special prosecutor Kari Morrissey, however, was dubious that Baldwin\u2019s lawyers, with whom she has clashed in the run-up to the trial, would make that possible. \u201cIt is my guess that with this group of defense attorneys, that\u2019s not gonna happen,\u201d Morrissey said at the hearing. Baldwin attorney Alex Spiro replied, \u201cI\u2019ve never not picked a jury in one day. I can\u2019t imagine that this would be the first time.\u201d Dozens of prospective jurors will be brought into the courtroom for questioning Tuesday morning. Cameras that will carry the rest of the proceedings will be turned off to protect their privacy. Jurors are expected to get the case after a nine-day trial. Attorneys will be able to request they be dismissed for conflicts or other causes. The defense under state law can dismiss up to five jurors without giving a reason, the prosecution three. More challenges will be allowed when four expected alternates are chosen. Before Marlowe Sommer\u2019s ruling Monday, prosecutors had hoped to highlight Baldwin\u2019s safety obligations on the set as co-producer to bolster an alternative theory of guilt beyond his alleged negligent use of a firearm. They aimed to link Baldwin\u2019s behavior to \u201ctotal disregard or indifference for the safety of others\u201d under the involuntary manslaughter law. But the prosecution managed other wins Monday. They successfully argued for the exclusion of summary findings from a state workplace safety investigation that placed much of the blame on the film\u2019s assistant director, shifting fault away from Baldwin. And the judge ruled that they could show graphic images from Hutchins\u2019 autopsy, and from police lapel cameras during the treatment of her injuries. ___ Dalton reported from Los Angeles. ___ For more coverage of Alec Baldwin\u2019s involuntary manslaughter trial, visit: https://apnews.com/hub/alec-baldwin",

        "text": "Few actors have had as successful or as prolific a career as Tom Hanks. The Cast Away actor has starred in numerous beloved movies and has won two Best Actor Oscars for his roles in Philadelphia and Forrest Gump. While he\u2019s incredibly hard-working, Tom\u2019s also made it known that he\u2019s a family man! The actor had two children with his first wife, Samantha Lewes (who sadly died in 2002) before they divorced in 1987, and two more with his current wife, Rita Wilson, to whom he\u2019s been married since 1988. Tom celebrated his 68th birthday on July 9, 2024. In 2023, Tom got a rare chance to work alongside one of his children. His youngest son, Truman, plays a younger version of Tom\u2019s character in A Man Called Otto. At the time, there was a recent discussion of nepotism in Hollywood. \u201cI think my kids are all like Renaissance artists, you know? [They] are good at whatever they choose to be,\u201d Tom said, per PEOPLE. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to have a passion, you\u2019ve got to have a drive. And yeah, our household has existed in the company town that is Los Angeles.\u201d Tom said that the director suggested that Truman play the younger version of his character \u201cbecause we resemble each other a lot. But the final analysis is the person has to show up on the day and hit the marks, and tell the truth. Only he can make that decision. It was totally up to him.\u201d Tom earlier suggested that Hollywood was a \u201cfamily business\u201d and that if the Hanks were involved in \u201ca plumbing-supply business or if we ran the florist shop down the street, the whole family would be putting in time at some point, even if it was just inventory at the end of the year,\u201d per PEOPLE. With that said, learn more about all four of Tom Hanks\u2019 kids \u2014 and what creative ventures they\u2019re involved with \u2014 here! Colin Hanks Tom and Samantha welcomed their son Colin, 46, into the world in 1977 before getting married in 1978. Colin really is the spitting image of his father. Colin has followed in his dad\u2019s footsteps to become a successful actor in his own right. His debut role was in the 1996 musical comedy That Thing You Do, which his old man wrote and directed. Two of Colin\u2019s biggest films are King Kong and Orange County. Most recently, he had a part in the comedy How It Ends alongside hilarious talents like Whitney Cummings and Nick Kroll. Other than movies, Colin has also started a family of his own and made Tom a grandfather. He\u2019s been married to publicist Samantha Bryant since 2010, and the pair have two daughters: Olivia and Charlotte. Despite building a lengthy resume of his own, Colin has rarely worked with his dad. The two starred in the 2006 comedy The Great Buck Howard as father and son, but Colin has seemed to try to focus on projects without his dad. While they may not share the screen very often, it\u2019s very clear that Tom has been a great role model for his son, as Colin revealed the best advice he gave in an August interview with HollywoodLife. \u201cI think, if there was anything, it\u2019s while it may go fast in the rearview mirror and it may feel like it\u2019s gone too quick, or sometimes maybe it feels like it goes to painstakingly slow, life is long, and there\u2019s a lot of time to be able to do the things that you want to do and the things that you need to do,\u201d he said. Elizabeth Hanks Tom\u2019s only daughter, Elizabeth, was born in 1982. The 42-year-old did make appearances in some of her dad\u2019s most popular movies when she was young: Forrest Gump and That Thing You Do, according to IMDb. but Elizabeth pursued a different creative outlet than acting. She received an English degree from Vassar College and became a writer via Suggest. She publishes under the name E.A. Hanks, and she is working on her debut children\u2019s book Piper Peregrine Vs. The Consortium For Better Thinking, according to her bio. She\u2019s also worked in journalism for Vanity Fair and The Huffington Post. Her Twitter bio boasts bylines from Time, The Guardian, and The New York Times. Chet Hanks Tom\u2019s oldest son, with his wife Rita, was born in 1990. Chet, 33, has embarked on his own entertainment journey, launching a music career in April 2021 with his debut single (under the name \u201cChet Hanx\u201d), \u201cWhite Boy Summer.\u201d He released his second song, \u201cDamn,\u201d in June. When his parents were diagnosed with COVID-19 in March 2020, Chet kept fans informed and told them that he wasn\u2019t worried and he was confident his parents would be okay. While his own mom and dad were some of the first major celebrities to test positive for COVID-19, Chet has recently ousted himself as an anti-vaxxer. He posted an Instagram video in August, where he mocked the COVID vaccine. \u201cI never had COVID. They ain\u2019t sticking me with that mothaf**king needle. It\u2019s the mothaf**king flu,\u201d he said. His aversion to the vaccine isn\u2019t the only questionable thing about Chet. His ex-girlfriend Kiana Parker filed a civil lawsuit against him in April 2021, alleging assault and battery and infliction of emotional distress. Truman Hanks Rita gave birth to her younger son in December 1995. Like his older half-brother, Truman, 28, also bares a striking resemblance to his dad when he was younger. He studied at Stanford University, according to Page Six. He also has a career in film \u2014 appearing on screen in 2023\u2019s A Man Called Otto and 2020\u2019s News Of The World \u2014 but Truman stays behind the camera. He\u2019s had various jobs in the camera and electrical departments on many major motion pictures, according to his IMDb. Some of the biggest movies he\u2019s worked on include Wrath of Man, Black Widow, and the upcoming West Wide Story remake. He\u2019s also been a production assistant on Charlie\u2019s Angels and The Cloverfield Paradox and was the cinematographer for a short film called The Ice Queen Society.",

Despite all the tireless work the organizations represented on these pages do to alleviate inequities in so many areas \u2014 in education, health care, housing, diversity \u2014 there will always be needs that remain unfilled. Still, there is one want that arguably trumps all others: hunger. Without enough to eat, all the arts programs and youth athletic leagues in the world aren\u2019t going to make much of a meaningful difference. Food, of course, is an essential human need. \u201cIt\u2019s fundamental,\u201d says Claire Babineaux-Fontenot, CEO of Feeding America, THR\u2018s 2024 Philanthropic Organization of the Year. \u201cIt cuts across every human main divide. Even right now, with this hyper-political climate that we\u2019re in, in the middle of a presidential race, celebrities can know that when they choose this, that they will find friends, partners, allies across the political spectrum. It\u2019s one of the places \u2014 and it feels like it\u2019s getting more and more rare to find those places \u2014 where we can all come and focus on our humanity.\u201d Feeding America has been fighting hunger since the 1960s, and today it\u2019s part of a nationwide network of more than 200 food banks and 60,000 meal programs that last year distributed 5.3 billion meals through such programs as mobile pantries and after-school Kids Cafes, while also focusing on disaster response and hunger research. The organization also puts an emphasis on providing access to a nutritious mix of food, working directly with farmers and producers to get healthier food into its pipeline. No surprise it\u2019s become one of Hollywood\u2019s favorite charities, with 100-plus stars participating in the nonprofit\u2019s various programs. Scarlett Johansson, for one, is a major supporter, telling THR that she considers Feeding America\u2019s mission to end hunger a \u201cdeeply personal\u201d campaign. \u201cGrowing up, my family relied on public assistance and free school lunch programs, and I witnessed firsthand how this support can offer immense relief to families struggling to make ends meet,\u201d she says. \u201cIt helped me understand from a young age that there is no shame in accepting assistance, only power.\u201d Other supporters include Andy Cohen, Emma Roberts, Rachael Ray, Karen Pittman, Chrissy Teigen, Justin Long, Phoebe Robinson and Julie Bowen (who\u2019ll be presenting Babineaux-Fontenot with THR Philanthropy of the Year honors at the Social Impact Summit on July 11). Liev Schreiber, who has worked with Feeding America for nearly a decade, says it\u2019s been an eye-opening experience. \u201cIt\u2019s been incredible to volunteer directly in communities, helping to serve meals and speak face-to-face with people about their experiences,\u201d he says. \u201cThere is often a misconception of what food insecurity looks like, but it exists in 100 percent of U.S. counties and is likely impacting people close to you.\u201d Having this much buy-in from Hollywood has obviously been enormously helpful in building Feeding America\u2019s public profile, but Babineaux-Fontenot insists the organization\u2019s A-list volunteers aren\u2019t treated any differently than anybody else at the food bank. \u201cWe might ooh and ahh when they walk in the door,\u201d she says, \u201cbut once they get on the line, it\u2019s like, \u2018Hey, Julie Bowen, chop, chop.\u2019 \u201c In 2024, with inflation keeping food prices too high for many families, Feeding America is seeing an alarming uptick in food insecurity. Counterintuitively, the situation now is worse than it was amid the pandemic, since that crisis triggered an unprecedented gusher of government aid. \u201cDuring 2020, people will be shocked to learn that we had one of the lowest rates of food insecurity that we\u2019ve ever had, but it\u2019s because we were doing the stuff that works,\u201d Babineaux-Fontenot says. \u201cIn 2021, some of those COVID-era supports started going away; by 2022, most of them were gone. The lines grew and grew and grew. Supports go away, inflation goes up, lines grow.\u201d Indeed, by 2022, the number of people living in food-insecure households in the U.S. jumped to 44 million, including 13 million children, according to a report released by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. It marked an increase of 31 percent for all individuals and 44 percent for children from 2021, when government assistance programs were still in full swing. \u201cThe things we were doing in 2020 and 2021, those things really helped,\u201d Babineaux-Fontenot says. \u201cWe could do more of those things and could change the face of hunger in this country.\u201d For Hollywood, 2023 was a year when food insecurity struck home, with thousands of writers and actors out of work due to the double strikes, which also created a ripple effect on other parts of the workforce. L.A. Regional Food Bank saw a 9 percent spike in requests for help, which appeared to be fueled by out-of-work members of the entertainment industry. \u201cI\u2019d love to see strong activation all across the celebrity community around destigmatizing the status of not having access to resources,\u201d Babineaux-Fontenot says. \u201cThe pain of some of them having to access pantries and food banks during the strike, I hope that translates into a passion around making sure that stigma goes away.\u201d She adds: \u201cWe understand that hunger does not come in a vacuum, that it does not exist by itself \u2014 it\u2019s a symptom of poverty. For us to be serious about hunger, we have to be aware of what are the things that contribute to a person not having the food that they need to thrive? And what role can we play in ensuring that the whole ecosystem comes together in a good way for people? So that\u2019s what we\u2019re working on.\u201d This story first appeared in the July 10 issue of The Hollywood Reporter magazine. Click here to subscribe.",

At the time, Burke, now 52, decided to share the news of her diagnosis in a video on YouTube \u2014 and as she told told chef Curtis Stone on his podcast, Getting Grilled, \u201cI didn't want it to be a headline and to start showing up everywhere with, like, that f----- up picture and \u2018Brooke has cancer.\u2019 \u201c \"I decided to tell my own story,\u201d Burke said.

It opposes LGBTQ people and people of other faiths or of no faith, and their civil rights. It often has links to neo-Nazis, white supremacy, and dominionism, and many see Russia and Russia\u2019s president, Vladimir Putin, as its leader. \u201cSome will say I\u2019m calling America a Christian nation. And so I am. Some will say I\u2019m advocating Christian nationalism. And so I do. My question is \u2013 is there any other kind worth having?\u201d Senator Hawley said at \u201cNatCon 4,\u201d the National Conservatism conference being held in Washington, D.C., this week (video below), as reported by Semafor\u2019s David Weigel. Sen. Hawley, not backing down, promoted his remarks by reposting them on social media. Senator Hawley told attendees at the far-right conference, \u201cChristian nationalism founded American democracy.. the Christian political tradition is our political tradition,\u201d Weigel also reported.

The Missouri MAGA GOP Senator\u2019s remarks echo a speech he gave just weeks ago, as Right Wing Watch reported: Last year in July, Hawley promoted the debunked claim that America was founded as a Christian nation, and delivered a speech, also at \u201cNatCon,\u201d titled \u201cBiblical Revolution,\u201d as Religion News Service reported.

Historically, however, Christian nationalism in America has also encompassed extremist ideologies,\u201d The Times reported. \u201cMr. Trump gained power in large part by offering to preserve the influence of white evangelicals and their values just as many feared that the world as they knew it was rapidly disappearing.\u201d It also looked at the history of Christian Nationalism. \u201cIn the 1948 presidential election, for example, a fringe political party called the Christian Nationalist Party nominated Gerald L. K. Smith, a pastor with pro-Nazi sympathies, and adopted an antisemitic, anti-Black platform that called for the deportation of people with whom it disagreed.\u201d National Conservatism is a multinational \u201cproject\u201d created by the Edmund Burke Foundation, a Netherlands-based group.

It opposes LGBTQ people and people of other faiths or of no faith, and their civil rights. It often has links to neo-Nazis, white supremacy, and dominionism, and many see Russia and Russia's president, Vladimir Putin, as its leader. \"Some will say I'm calling America a Christian nation. And so I am. Some will say I'm advocating Christian nationalism. And so I do. My question is - is there any other kind worth having?\" Senator Hawley said at \"NatCon 4,\" the National Conservatism conference being held in Washington, D.C., this week (video below), as reported by Semafor's David Weigel. Sen. Hawley, not backing down, promoted his remarks by reposting them on social media. Senator Hawley told attendees at the far-right conference, \"Christian nationalism founded American democracy.. the Christian political tradition is our political tradition,\" Weigel also reported.

Historically, however, Christian nationalism in America has also encompassed extremist ideologies,\" The Times reported. \"Mr. Trump gained power in large part by offering to preserve the influence of white evangelicals and their values just as many feared that the world as they knew it was rapidly disappearing.\" It also looked at the history of Christian Nationalism. \"In the 1948 presidential election, for example, a fringe political party called the Christian Nationalist Party nominated Gerald L. K. Smith, a pastor with pro-Nazi sympathies, and adopted an antisemitic, anti-Black platform that called for the deportation of people with whom it disagreed.\" National Conservatism is a multinational \"project\" created by the Edmund Burke Foundation, a Netherlands-based group.

        "text": "The United States on Monday teased \"positive\" news for Ukraine on deliveries of Patriot air defense systems.\"There will be fresh news on air defense. The Ukrainians asked NATO for seven Patriot systems in April. And we have a very positive response on that, which will come in the next few days,\" U.S. Ambassador to NATO Julianne Smith said during a Foreign Policy online discussion, Voice of America reported Tuesday.Ukraine is currently in possession of at least two Patriot missile defense systems\u2014one donated by the U.S., and another which was jointly sent to the war-torn country by Germany and the Netherlands.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has said that Ukraine needs at a \"minimum\" of \"seven more 'Patriots' or similar air defense systems\" to protect his country from Russian attacks in the full-scale invasion launched by President Vladimir Putin in February 2022.Putin \"must be brought down to earth, and our sky must become safe again \u2026 And it depends fully on your choice \u2026[the] choice whether we are indeed allies,\" the Ukrainian leader said in April in a speech to the NATO-Ukraine Council.Smith said \"it will be a big week\" in Washington, referring to the NATO summit, which will be held Tuesday through July 11.The U.S. Ambassador to the NATO military alliance said to be on the lookout for \"specific announcements that will come for Ukraine, for NATO allies, news about defense production, about sustainability, about cybersecurity.\"Zelensky \"will feel the steadfast commitment to Ukraine\" from NATO, she said.\"We will have a financial commitment, according to which both Ukraine and Moscow will understand very clearly that we, the trans-Atlantic partners, will not back down. As you know, Putin predicted that we would all turn away. We are not distracted. We are focused on the issue of Ukraine and are going to stick to the chosen course, so keep an eye out for announcements of financial commitments,\" Smith added.Smith's comments came as Russia launched one of its deadliest attacks of the year, its troops sending a barrage of missiles to hit targets across the country, including the Okhmatdyt Children's Hospital in Kyiv. At least 38 people were killed and 190 injured nationwide.Russia denied targeting the children's hospital, saying on Monday that debris from a Ukrainian air-defense missile had hit the facility. Ukraine said the Russians used a Kh-101 cruise missile to attack the site. Ukraine's Security Service said it had found wreckage from the weapon.\"The experts' conclusions are unequivocal\u2014it was a direct strike,\" Ukraine's State Security Service said on Telegram. Newsweek has as yet been unable to verify this.Russian military analyst Ian Matveev assessed on X, formerly Twitter, why Kyiv's air defense couldn't \"cope with the massive shelling of cruise missiles\" on Monday.\"If we remember past attacks, missiles and drones attacked Kyiv in waves, gradually. Perhaps this time, the Russian military was able to guess and send all the missiles at once, in a short period of time. For example, in 2-3 minutes. Hence these concentrated attacks of 5-6 missiles in just a few tens of seconds,\" he said.\"But the Ukrainian air defense system turned out to be not powerful enough to overcome such an overload at the moment,\" Matveev continued.\"In any case, the root cause is clear, the lack of modern systems such as Patriot. For full-fledged and layered defense, Ukraine needs at least 10 more complete complexes of 8 launchers each,\" he added. \"Then it will be possible to shoot down a significant part of the missiles on approach to Kyiv and it will not be possible to create an overload.\"Do you have a tip on a world news story that Newsweek should be covering?

World leaders condemned the attack, as NATO leaders gather in Washington today to celebrate the alliance's 75th birthday. Ukraine declared Tuesday a day of mourning. Who said what Ukraine's military said it shot down 30 of 38 missiles during the attack, but Russia is getting more adept at evading air defenses. The Okhmatdyt Children's Hospital was struck by a Russian Kh-101 cruise missile, according to Ukraine's Security Service. The attack \"caused debris to fall into heart patients' open chests in the middle of surgery,\" The Associated Press said. \"Cancer patients had their beds wheeled into parks and onto the streets.\" \"Among the victims were Ukraine's sickest children,\" said Volker T\u00fcrk, the U.N. human rights commissioner. \"This is abominable.\" British Prime Minister Kier Starmer said \"attacking innocent children\" was \"depraved.\" President Joe Biden called the strikes a \"horrific reminder of Russia's brutality.\" Russia claimed it struck only military targets. Ukraine's Health Ministry said Russia has damaged more than 1,600 medical facilities and destroyed 214 since invading in February 2022. Attacking hospitals with no military value is a war crime. What next? The White House said NATO leaders will announce new measures to strengthen Ukraine's air defenses during their summit. The U.N. Security Council is also holding an emergency meeting on Tuesday at the request of France and Ecuador. Subscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

        "text": "Jeff Goldblum is welcoming Scarlett Johansson to the Jurassic Park film franchise! Goldblum, 71, surprised Johansson, 39, with a video message on Monday, July 8, while she was on Today to promote her new movie, Fly Me to the Moon. In the clip, he congratulated the actress on joining the cast of the next Jurassic World movie. After Johansson told Today's Savannah Guthrie that she is a major fan of the Jurassic films, which first kicked off with the 1993 original, the show displayed a video showing Goldblum, who has appeared in three of the movies, wearing a velociraptor sweater and a suit as he delivered a message. \"Doctor Johansson, this is Jeff Goldblum. Here's what I want to say to you. This I know: Scarlett will find a way,\" he said, paraphrasing his character's classic line from the Steven Spielberg-directed movie. \"I love you so so much. Don't get eaten, unless you want to. I love you. Mwah!\" Johansson laughed as she watched the video and let out an audible \"no way!\" as the actor referenced his character Dr. Ian Malcolm's classic line. \"Oh my gosh, I can't believe Jeff actually said that to me. I mean, I think my life is complete now. I can retire,\" she joked. Before Guthrie played Goldblum's video message, Johansson recalled on how the original Jurassic Park was \"one of the first movies I remember seeing in the theater.\" \"I was probably like 10 or 11, and it was absolutely transformative for me,\" she said of the Oscar-winning adventure movie. \"I mean, the experience was \u2014 we had never seen anything like that, CGI used in that way. And when you see it, it still holds up. I mean, it looks so great.\" Never miss a story \u2014 sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer\u200b\u200b, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories. The producers behind the Jurassic World movies announced in February that the series' next film is set to release in theaters on July 2, 2025. Johansson was first reported to be in talks to lead the franchise into the future in March. She, along with franchise newcomer Jonathan Bailey, are teaming up with director Gareth Edwards (Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, The Creator) and screenwriter David Koepp, who originally adapted Michael Crichton's Jurassic Park novel for the screen, for the latest sequel. Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard previously starred in the most recent three Jurassic movies, the last of which released in 2022. \"I've been trying to get into this franchise in any possible way for over 10 years,\" Johansson recently told ComicBook.com of her casting in the film. She added, \"I'm like, 'I'll die in the first five minutes! I can get eaten by whatever! I'll do the craft service!' I'll do anything for it. The fact that it's happened in this way at this time just is actually unbelievable. I can't believe it.\" Fly Me to the Moon, in which Johansson costars with Channing Tatum, is in theaters July 12.",

As a self-described novice runner with very little natural athletic ability, every run brought an equally miserable pain in a new body part. While we are active users of Therabody\u2019s award-winning Theragun, it took merely a few runs before we found Therabody\u2019s RecoveryTherm Cube\u2014a portable, wearable, and reusable device powered by Cryothermal Technology\u2122. From my aching calves, rolled ankles, and shin splints to my partner\u2019s knee pain, stiff hips, and sore glutes, the Cube had its work cut out for it. The compact device features three preset treatments: cold therapy for relieving joint pain and reducing inflammation; heat therapy to combat muscle soreness, stiffness, and poor circulation; and contrast therapy that combines both temperatures to maximize recovery and reduce soreness. Each preset is programmed to deliver fast, controlled treatment directly to the skin using temperatures and durations scientifically proven to be the most productive amounts needed for effective relief. Generally, these treatments are performed with large tubs of hot and cold water or cycling through heating patches and ice packs to stimulate blood flow, increase circulation, and reduce soreness. The RecoveryTherm Cube harnesses the healing powers of temperature in a ventilated, portable, compact cube\u2014just an inch smaller than the iPhone 15. After every run, we quickly picked up a pattern of strapping the adjustable velcro strap across our pain points. With a low hum, the portable device treated targeted areas of pain while cooling down from a grueling run, allowing us to take advantage of the mobility. While we initially struggled to use the device and found the straps more challenging to adjust than expected, one read of the instructions and some practice solved any operator issues. The Cube works best for minor aches and pains in small, treatable areas. For more brutal, full-body days, we moved the device around to treat the entirety of the pain. While it\u2019s hard to say if our workouts improved because of the RecoveryTherm Cube, I can say the hands-free, no-thought route to recovery made the next day\u2019s workout much more bearable.

        "text": "WASHINGTON -- Leaders of NATO countries gathered on July 9 in Washington for a summit to discuss ways to bolster the alliance's defense capabilities and support Ukraine against the backdrop of political uncertainty in the host country and Russia's intense bombing of Ukraine, whose leader arrived at midday to press Kyiv's needs. NATO is expected to announce plans for European members to boost spending on weapons and ammunition procurement following years of underinvestment as well as a 40 billion-euro ($43 billion) aid package for Ukraine. The agenda of the three-day summit, which will mark NATO's 75th anniversary, will be partially overshadowed by concerns about U.S. President Joe Biden's age and ability to lead after his chances of winning reelection this November took a hit following his dismal debate performance against Republican contender Donald Trump last month. Support and aid to Ukraine is likely to take on even greater immediacy at the summit following one of the worst Russian air attacks on the country since the Kremlin launched the full-scale invasion in February 2022. The barrage of missiles fired across Ukraine on July 8 struck several civilian facilities, including Kyiv's Okhmatdyt Children's Hospital, killing at least 41 people in total and injuring scores more in what Biden called a \"horrific reminder of Russia's brutality.\" Michael Carpenter, senior director for NATO at the National Security Council, told reporters on July 8 that the allies will announce new measures to bolster Ukraine's security, including air defense and F-16 fighter jets, but he did not give any details. A senior NATO official, briefing reporters on condition of anonymity, said that despite dwindling resources, Russia would likely be able to maintain its war economy for three to four years. However, the official added that the Kremlin lacked the munitions and troops to launch a major offensive against Ukraine in the near term. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has for months pleaded with NATO members for more air defense, especially the U.S.-made Patriot missile system, to defend its troops, cities, and infrastructure against large-scale Russian bombing campaigns. Upon arriving at the summit and ahead of his expected speech later on July 9, Zelenskiy said he would also press for NATO commitments on additional warplanes and to provide enhanced security guarantees. In a video posted on his Telegram account, Zelenskiy said: \"We are fighting for additional security guarantees for Ukraine. And these consist of weapons and finances, political support.\" \"We are doing, and will always do everything, to make the Russian terrorist lose,\" he added. The alliance will also announce a new NATO military command in Germany to coordinate the training and equipping of Ukrainian troops and station a senior NATO representative in Kyiv. However, the summit will not extend an invitation for Ukraine to join the alliance. Carpenter said there was still no consensus on the issue among the 32 allies. The NATO communique is expected to say that Ukraine belongs in the alliance without giving a time frame for when it will join. NATO members also couldn't agree on a multiyear military aid package for Ukraine that outgoing Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg had proposed. Instead, NATO will announce a one-year, 40 billion-euro package. Biden and Zelenskiy will meet on July 11 and be joined by the leaders of about two dozen other countries that have signed bilateral security agreements with Ukraine. Biden last month signed a 10-year agreement that calls on the United States, among other things, to help bolster Ukraine's military-industrial complex through co-production and joint ventures with U.S. industry. The expected announcements have disappointed some Western supporters of Ukraine who want greater aid and a clearer path into NATO. \"I don't see this summit doing much for Ukraine at all,\" Kurt Volker, who served as U.S. ambassador to NATO in 2008-09 and former special envoy to Ukraine in 2017-19, told the Center for a New American Security earlier this month. But Carpenter said the commitments made to Ukraine during the summit will show that Russian President Vladimir Putin's strategy of outlasting the alliance won't work. NATO unity on Ukraine, however, will be challenged at the summit by Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, whose pro-Russian views have irked the alliance. Orban, who just took over the rotating presidency of the EU, flew to Moscow last week without informing the bloc ahead of time to discuss an end to the war with Putin. The trip was denounced by Zelenskiy, the EU, and the Biden administration. NATO Spending Defense spending by NATO members will be another hot topic at the summit. NATO members committed a decade ago to reach a defense spending target of at least 2 percent of gross national product by 2024. Stoltenberg said that 23 of the alliance's 32 members will meet that target this year. \"One of the things you'll see at the summit, certainly behind closed doors, is that there'll be a lot of allies holding each other's feet to the fire in terms of defense spending commitments,\" Carpenter said. U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson (Republican-Louisiana), a Trump ally, said on July 8 that Republicans \"celebrate the peace and stability that NATO has secured...but we also believe that NATO needs to be doing more.\" \u201cEveryone cannot ride along on the coattails of America. And Donald Trump says this as bluntly as anyone. It\u2019s just right and fair for us to demand that others do their part,\u201d he said. The United States accounts for 68 percent of NATO defense spending. Some Western officials say 2 percent should be a floor, not a ceiling, and that NATO members should be spending 2.5 percent or more amid growing threats from Russia, China, and Iran. \"If we look into the future, and we look into fully resourcing our defense plans and preparing for all possible contingency, this will require for a number of countries to go beyond 2 percent,\" Benedetta Berti, head of policy planning in the office of the NATO secretary-general. Johnson, who spoke at the Hudson Institute, a Washington think tank, said Republicans were pushing for a \"self-reliant European defense industrial base.\" Trump harangued NATO allies when he was president for not meeting their spending commitments, threatening at one point to withdraw the United States from the alliance. Biden's poor debate performance and the specter of another Trump presidency has many European allies worried. But National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said the White House had not picked up any signed from allies that they need to \"be reassured of American leadership and President Biden's commitments.\" Strengthening ties with Asian partners to contain China will be another topic at the summit. NATO allies will be joined by the leaders of four Asian countries, including Japan, South Korea, Australia, and New Zealand. NATO members have criticized China for supplying Russia with electronics used in weapons production. \"The global threats and challenges we face, including from authoritarian actors and terrorist organizations, are all inextricably linked,\" Carpenter said. For Stoltenberg, the summit is expected to be his last major event before he departs the alliance on October 1. He will be replaced by Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte.

        "text": "Russia's missile barrage across Ukraine on Monday shows how urgently NATO members must back giving Kyiv more air defense capabilities, a board member of the children's hospital that was among the sites struck has told Newsweek.The comments by Ukrainian lawmaker Mariya Ionova at the start of NATO's 75th-anniversary summit echo calls Kyiv has been making for months for more help from the alliance and other countries to thwart Russian missiles and drones.Kyiv had asked NATO for seven Patriot systems in April, and the United States ambassador to the alliance, Julianne Smith, said a decision is expected this week amid outrage over the biggest Russian missile attack for months.Ionova arrived at Okhmatdyt Children's Hospital in Kyiv, where she is on the board of trustees, to find the devastating aftermath of a strike that had destroyed part of the country's biggest pediatric facility and killed at least two adults. Kyiv said it was a Kh-101 air-launched cruise missile.\"I saw wounded doctors trying to save people and to find children,\" she told Newsweek, describing how, in the melee, there were two air alarms warning of further danger.\"When we were transporting children to ambulances, all the corridors were covered in blood, and there were very scared children. It's too much for them to have oncology diseases and to face such terrorism,\" she said.She said 627 children were in the hospital when it was hit, eight of whom were injured. There were 94 who were taken to other facilities in Kyiv, while 68 remained for treatment in the buildings that were unscathed in the strike.Another 465 children who needed planned treatment were examined and temporarily discharged home. A separate maternity unit in Kyiv was partially destroyed by falling debris, killing four.\"This is over the line\u2014to fire at children with cancer in a targeted manner. I don't know where there are red lines in this brutality and terror because it was on purpose,\" said Ionova, a member of Ukraine's European Solidarity party.Newsweek reached out to the Russian Defense Ministry and the Kremlin for comment.The Kremlin has repeated its denials since the start of the war, insisting that it does not target civilian infrastructure. Moscow said the hospital had been hit by fragments of a Ukrainian air defense missile.In an assessment emailed to Newsweek, analysis firm Fenix Insight said Tuesday that Russia's claims \"are not credible, based on the imagery shown of the missile in flight and the structural damage on the hospital buildings.\"The treatment needs of the children at Okhmatdyt Hospital are complex, and the facility provides specialized care.\"This missile was really very powerful because operational departments, toxicology departments, the hemodialysis department are destroyed totally,\" Ionova said. \"Now, there is an assessment over what equipment we still have.\"Colonel Yuriy Ihnat, head of public relations at Ukraine's Air Forces, said the missiles flew at \"extremely low\" altitudes, which the Institute for the Study of War suggested showed a change of Moscow's tactics, with the aim of giving Ukrainian air defense no time to respond so as \"to inflict maximum damage.\"Monday's strikes are likely to further focus Kyiv's allies on providing more weapons and air defense capabilities. Ukrainian media reported that Ukraine and Poland are working on a system in which Polish air defense will shoot down Russian missiles and drones.Tuesday was observed as a day of mourning across Ukraine following the missile strikes which killed at least 41 people and injured 166. Ionova said in response, Kyiv is expecting a strong reaction from its allies to \"stop Russia in Ukraine because we would like to have peace.\"\"Unfortunately, we will only get peace only when we get more long-range missiles, air defense, and F-16s to protect us and to destroy Russian military infrastructure,\" she said.",

He will attend the summit as an observer, along with his South Korean, Japanese, and New Zealand counterparts for the third straight year as NATO engages nonmember partners in the Asia-Pacific region, with an eye on China and North Korea. Australia will be represented by its Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence Richard Marles.South Korea, along with the United States and others, condemned the agreement signed last month by Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean counterpart Kim Jong Un, pledging military assistance if either country is attacked.Yoon told Reuters that the future of South Korea's relationship with Russia depends entirely on Russia. He urged the country to decide which Korea better serves its interests.\"We categorically disagree with this approach,\" Putin's Press Secretary Dmitry Peskov said to Russian state media. Peskov added that Russia seeks good relations with both Koreas, saying that Pyongyang is a partner while Seoul has joined the anti-Russian sanctions. \"How can we build good relations with countries that take a hostile position toward us?\" Peskov added.Tensions between North and South Korea are at their highest in decades. The suspension of a 2018 military agreement has led to the resumption of military exercises along the demarcation line separating the neighbors and near northwest border islands.South Korea, which hopes to become the world's fourth-largest arms dealer by 2027, said it was mulling arming Ukraine after the Moscow-Pyongyang deal was inked. Putin warned such a move would be \"a big mistake.\"Yoon told Reuters that whether the South decides to provide Ukraine with weaponry depends on \"the level and substance of military cooperation between Russia and North Korea.\" Yoon gave transfers of weapons and military technology as examples of areas Seoul will be watching.North Korea has helped replenish Russian forces' stocks of artillery munitions and ballistic missiles. South Korean Defense Minister Shin Won-sik said at least 10,000 shipping containers have been transferred to Russia, enough to hold about 5 million artillery shells.Asked about reports South Korea and the other three observer states would reach an agreement this week to boost cooperation with NATO, China's Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian on Monday called the security alliance a \"Cold War legacy.\" He accused NATO of expanding beyond its mandate as a regional alliance and warned it against attempts \"to destabilize the Asia-Pacific after it has done so to Europe.\"",

        "text": "WASHINGTON -- Leaders of NATO countries gathered on July 9 in Washington for a summit to discuss ways to bolster the alliance's defense capabilities and support Ukraine against the backdrop of political uncertainty in the host country and Russia's intense bombing of Ukraine, whose leader arrived at midday to press Kyiv's needs. NATO is expected to announce plans for European members to boost spending on weapons and ammunition procurement following years of underinvestment as well as a 40 billion-euro ($43 billion) aid package for Ukraine. The agenda of the three-day summit, which will mark NATO's 75th anniversary, will be partially overshadowed by concerns about U.S. President Joe Biden's age and ability to lead after his chances of winning reelection this November took a hit following his dismal debate performance against Republican contender Donald Trump last month. Support and aid to Ukraine is likely to take on even greater immediacy at the summit following one of the worst Russian air attacks on the country since the Kremlin launched the full-scale invasion in February 2022. The barrage of missiles fired across Ukraine on July 8 struck several civilian facilities, including Kyiv's Okhmatdyt Children's Hospital, killing at least 41 people in total and injuring scores more in what Biden called a \"horrific reminder of Russia's brutality.\" Michael Carpenter, senior director for NATO at the National Security Council, told reporters on July 8 that the allies will announce new measures to bolster Ukraine's security, including air defense and F-16 fighter jets, but he did not give any details. A senior NATO official, briefing reporters on condition of anonymity, said that despite dwindling resources, Russia would likely be able to maintain its war economy for three to four years. However, the official added that the Kremlin lacked the munitions and troops to launch a major offensive against Ukraine in the near term. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has for months pleaded with NATO members for more air defense, especially the U.S.-made Patriot missile system, to defend its troops, cities, and infrastructure against large-scale Russian bombing campaigns. Upon arriving at the summit and ahead of his expected speech later on July 9, Zelenskiy said he would also press for NATO commitments on additional warplanes and to provide enhanced security guarantees. In a video posted on his Telegram account, Zelenskiy said: \"We are fighting for additional security guarantees for Ukraine. And these consist of weapons and finances, political support.\" \"We are doing, and will always do everything, to make the Russian terrorist lose,\" he added. The alliance will also announce a new NATO military command in Germany to coordinate the training and equipping of Ukrainian troops and station a senior NATO representative in Kyiv. However, the summit will not extend an invitation for Ukraine to join the alliance. Carpenter said there was still no consensus on the issue among the 32 allies. The NATO communique is expected to say that Ukraine belongs in the alliance without giving a time frame for when it will join. NATO members also couldn't agree on a multiyear military aid package for Ukraine that outgoing Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg had proposed. Instead, NATO will announce a one-year, 40 billion-euro package. Biden and Zelenskiy will meet on July 11 and be joined by the leaders of about two dozen other countries that have signed bilateral security agreements with Ukraine. Biden last month signed a 10-year agreement that calls on the United States, among other things, to help bolster Ukraine's military-industrial complex through co-production and joint ventures with U.S. industry. The expected announcements have disappointed some Western supporters of Ukraine who want greater aid and a clearer path into NATO. \"I don't see this summit doing much for Ukraine at all,\" Kurt Volker, who served as U.S. ambassador to NATO in 2008-09 and former special envoy to Ukraine in 2017-19, told the Center for a New American Security earlier this month. But Carpenter said the commitments made to Ukraine during the summit will show that Russian President Vladimir Putin's strategy of outlasting the alliance won't work. NATO unity on Ukraine, however, will be challenged at the summit by Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, whose pro-Russian views have irked the alliance. Orban, who just took over the rotating presidency of the EU, flew to Moscow last week without informing the bloc ahead of time to discuss an end to the war with Putin. The trip was denounced by Zelenskiy, the EU, and the Biden administration. NATO Spending Defense spending by NATO members will be another hot topic at the summit. NATO members committed a decade ago to reach a defense spending target of at least 2 percent of gross national product by 2024. Stoltenberg said that 23 of the alliance's 32 members will meet that target this year. \"One of the things you'll see at the summit, certainly behind closed doors, is that there'll be a lot of allies holding each other's feet to the fire in terms of defense spending commitments,\" Carpenter said. U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson (Republican-Louisiana), a Trump ally, said on July 8 that Republicans \"celebrate the peace and stability that NATO has secured...but we also believe that NATO needs to be doing more.\" \u201cEveryone cannot ride along on the coattails of America. And Donald Trump says this as bluntly as anyone. It\u2019s just right and fair for us to demand that others do their part,\u201d he said. The United States accounts for 68 percent of NATO defense spending. Some Western officials say 2 percent should be a floor, not a ceiling, and that NATO members should be spending 2.5 percent or more amid growing threats from Russia, China, and Iran. \"If we look into the future, and we look into fully resourcing our defense plans and preparing for all possible contingency, this will require for a number of countries to go beyond 2 percent,\" Benedetta Berti, head of policy planning in the office of the NATO secretary-general. Johnson, who spoke at the Hudson Institute, a Washington think tank, said Republicans were pushing for a \"self-reliant European defense industrial base.\" Trump harangued NATO allies when he was president for not meeting their spending commitments, threatening at one point to withdraw the United States from the alliance. Biden's poor debate performance and the specter of another Trump presidency has many European allies worried. But National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said the White House had not picked up any signed from allies that they need to \"be reassured of American leadership and President Biden's commitments.\" Strengthening ties with Asian partners to contain China will be another topic at the summit. NATO allies will be joined by the leaders of four Asian countries, including Japan, South Korea, Australia, and New Zealand. NATO members have criticized China for supplying Russia with electronics used in weapons production. \"The global threats and challenges we face, including from authoritarian actors and terrorist organizations, are all inextricably linked,\" Carpenter said. For Stoltenberg, the summit is expected to be his last major event before he departs the alliance on October 1. He will be replaced by Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte.

        "text": "The world\u2019s biggest media and tech moguls have landed in Sun Valley, Idaho for the annual billionaire CEOs\u2019 conference that dates back to the 1980s. But some of the biggest names in business are missing from the guest list this year. Known as the \u201csummer camp for billionaires,\u201d the Sun Valley conference \u2014 hosted by a boutique New York investment firm, Allen & Co. \u2014 is arguably more impactful than the World Economic Forum in Davos. Sure, Davos gives global company executives the chance to publicly talk about global issues \u2014 this year it drew 1,600 business leaders and 60 heads of state and government. But Sun Valley is where multi-billion dollar deals orchestrated by the biggest names in business are hammered out behind closed doors. The initial talks for such deals as Jeff Bezos\u2019 purchase of The Washington Post and Comcast\u2019s acquisition of NBC Universal reportedly took place in Sun Valley. In the 1990s, Warren Buffett, a regular attendee of the conference, helped initiate talks between Disney and ABC that led to one of the largest deals ever (in 1995, at least). But Buffett won\u2019t be around to orchestrate any deals this year. The Berkshire Hathaway chairman and Tesla CEO may be regular attendees of the billionaires summer camp, but they aren\u2019t on the guest list this year, Variety reported. Other Berkshire Hathaway executives will stand in for Buffett, who has reportedly struggled with poor balance (he is 93-years-old, after all) and previously relied on a golf cart to get around the conference. And last year, Buffett\u2019s wife was overheard complaining about having to pay $4 for a cup of coffee, the New York Post reported at the time. Elon Musk will also be absent for the second year in a row. The Tesla CEO made a splash in Sun Valley in 2022 when he dodged questions over his Twitter deal. Here\u2019s who is at the conference Bill Gates Jeff Bezos OpenAI CEO Sam Altman Apple CEO Tim Cook Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg Amazon CEO Andy Jassy National Amusements president Shari Redstone Disney CEO Bob Iger Blumhouse Productions CEO Jason Blum Warner Bros.

        "text": "When it comes to summer cocktails, seasonal and fruit-forward drinks are the move. Ask Julianna McIntosh, San Diego-based cocktail influencer and author of the forthcoming cocktail recipe book, \u201cPretty Simple Cocktails\u201d (Clarkson Potter, $25). Here are three of her summer-inspired recipes, a trio that\u2019s sure to help you stay cool and relaxed as you ride out the heat. Fro-Secco Spritz Get out the blender for this slushy drink that\u2019s all about carefree vacation vibes, McIntosh writes. She blends in frozen mango chunks and orange segments rather than ice to keep the drink from becoming diluted. Note: Either use a large blender when mixing carbonated ingredients or add them at the end to prevent frothy overflow. Makes 2 spritzes INGREDIENTS 6 ounces prosecco (try La Marca prosecco) 5 ounces Aperol or Aperitivo Cappelletti 5 frozen orange segments (see tip below) 1 cup frozen mango chunks 1/2 cup crushed ice 4 ounces club soda Fresh orange wheels, for garnish Mint leaves, for garnish DIRECTIONS In a blender, combine the prosecco, Aperol, frozen orange segments, frozen mango chunks, and ice and blend, slowly growing to a medium- high speed until smooth. Divide between two stemless wine glasses (standard white wine glasses or rocks glasses also work) and stir in the club soda. Garnish each with a fresh orange wheel and fresh mint leaves and serve with a straw. Tip: To freeze the orange, peel the orange and separate it into segments. Arrange the orange segments \ufb02at on a tray or plate, not touching one another, and place in the freezer until frozen solid. Once frozen, store in a zip-seal bag in the freezer. Lemon Prosecco Pops Make these ice pops ahead of your next summer party and serve either straight from the ice pop molds or inverted into glasses of prosecco, McIntosh suggests. Makes 10 ice pops Special tools: 10 (3-ounce) ice pop molds INGREDIENTS 1/4 cup granulated sugar 2 cups water 2 cups prosecco, plus more for serving (try La Marca Prosecco) Grated zest of 1 lemon 1/3 cup (or 2\u00bd ounces) freshly squeezed lemon juice (about 3 large lemons) 10 mint sprigs DIRECTIONS In a medium saucepan, combine the sugar and water and stir over medium heat until the sugar fully dissolves. Set aside at room temperature to allow the syrup to cool completely. In a big mixing glass or pitcher, stir together the cooled syrup, prosecco, lemon zest, and lemon juice. Divide the mixture among ten 3-ounce ice pop molds. Place a mint sprig in each mold. Freeze for at least 4 hours or until solid. Pop out and serve. Tip: Don\u2019t have ice pop molds? Freeze these in ice cube trays and use the resulting cubes to chill your next glass of prosecco. Bourbon & Basil Smash \u201cThink of this as the mint julep\u2019s sassy, summery cousin,\u201d McIntosh writes. Makes 1 cocktail INGREDIENTS 2 ounces bourbon (try Four Roses) 3/4 ounce freshly squeezed lemon juice 1/2 ounce basil simple syrup (see recipe and tip below) Standard ice cubes, for shaking Large ice cube, for serving 1 ounce ginger beer, such as Fever Tree, for topping Basil sprig, for garnish DIRECTIONS Put a rocks glass in the freezer to chill. In a cocktail shaker, combine the bourbon, lemon juice and basil syrup. Add ice, cover, and shake vigorously for 30 seconds. Double-strain into the chilled rocks glass over a large ice cube. Top with the ginger beer. Place a fresh sprig of basil on top. Herbaceous Syrups Makes about 1\u00bd cups (12 ounces) INGREDIENTS 1 cup granulated sugar Herb of choice: 8 medium basil leaves or 2 tablespoons food-grade dried lavender flowers (or fresh lavender blossoms) or 8 thyme sprigs or 5 rosemary sprigs 1 cup filtered water DIRECTIONS In a saucepan, combine the sugar, herb and water and bring to a simmer over medium heat, stirring occasionally until the sugar has completely dissolved. Reduce to a simmer to allow the flavors to infuse and simmer until the syrup is tinted slightly to reflect the color of the herb, about 10 minutes. Remove from the heat and let cool to room temperature. Strain through a fine-mesh sieve into a measuring cup, pressing against the herbs with the back of a silicone spatula to extract all the syrup. Funnel it into an airtight container or syrup bottle and store in the refrigerator for up to 1 month. Tip: Quick basil syrup on the go! If you\u2019re low on basil simple syrup, add 1/2 ounce simple syrup plus 3 or 4 basil leaves right into your shaker instead. \u2014 Courtesy Julianna McIntosh, \u201cPretty Simple Cocktails\u201d (Clarkson Potter, $25)",

For Stoltenberg, the summit is expected to be his last major event before he departs the alliance on October 1. He will be replaced by Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte.

        "text": "Alec Baldwin has a high-profile \u2014 and, it turns out, expensive \u2014 legal team fighting his involuntary manslaughter charge. Alex Spiro of the law firm Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan has previously charged a client $2,025 per hour, an amount revealed in legal documents obtained by PEOPLE. The Harvard-educated attorney, who worked with billionaire Elon Musk during his takeover of Twitter (now known as X), charged the amount while representing Charlie Javice, an entrepreneur indicted on charges of fraud and conspiracy in 2023. Javice, who founded the student loan company Frank, sold her business to JP Morgan Chase for $175 million in 2021. But after the financial giant acquired the company, they claimed Javice falsely inflated the number of customers she had prior to the takeover. JP Morgan Chase sued her for fraud, and federal prosecutors soon brought criminal charges as well. A judge in the case ruled last year that JP Morgan Chase was legally obligated to pay Javice\u2019s attorney fees. In court documents associated with the case, Spiro\u2019s $2,025 per hour fee was revealed. It is unclear if Baldwin, 66, is paying Sprio that amount. Spiro, who is just one of several lawyers representing Baldwin, did not immediately reply to a request for comment about his past and current fees. If Baldwin were to pay that premium amount, a regular 40 hour work week would cost Baldwin $81,000 for Spiro alone. Spiro is also representing New York City mayor Eric Adams in a sexual harassment lawsuit brought by a former aide who alleges inappropriate conduct three decades ago. (Adams has denied wrongdoing.) According to ABC News, Spiro is charging the embattled official only $250 per hour, a discount of more than 87 percent. According to Vanity Fair, Spiro has also represented Jay-Z, Mick Jagger and Naomi Osaka.

Baldwin is on trial for involuntary manslaughter for his role in the accidental shooting death of Rust cinematographer Halyna Hutchins. The actor was holding a prop gun on the New Mexico set of the Western in 2021 when it discharged, killing Hutchins and injuring director Joel Souza. The Emmy winner, who has pleaded not guilty, insists he did not pull the trigger or know how the gun came to contain live ammunition. If convicted, he faces up to 18 months in prison. Rust armorer Hannah Gutierrez-Reed, the person in charge of weapons on the movie set, was convicted in March of involuntary manslaughter for her role in Hutchins\u2019 death. She is currently serving an 18 month sentence while she appeals.",

        "text": "Kirsten Dunst took playing a war photographer extremely seriously. \u201cI just carried that camera around all the time,\u201d the Oscar-nominated actress, 42, recalls of filming Civil War, the A24 drama from writer-director Alex Garland, in a behind-the-scenes video shared exclusively with PEOPLE. \u201cAs soon as I got the role I was like, \u2018Alex, give me the camera,\u2019 \u201d says Dunst in the clip, adding that she \u201cwas a little bit insecure\u201d about creating an accurate portrayal of her character, a photojournalist named Lee Smith. \u201cThat was my biggest fear, actually, looking like I didn\u2019t know what I was doing with the camera, or holding it in a way that it wasn\u2019t like a part of my body,\u201d she adds. Civil War imagines \u201ca journey across a dystopian future America,\u201d per its synopsis. It follows \u201ca team of military-embedded journalists as they race against time to reach DC before rebel factions descend upon the White House.\u201d Its cast includes Wagner Moura, Stephen McKinley Henderson, Cailee Spaeny and Nick Offerman, as well as Dunst's husband Jesse Plemons. \u201cIt\u2019s been the most fun I\u2019ve had when it comes to researching a character,\u201d says Spaeny, 25, of playing aspiring photographer Jessie Cullen. \u201cSome of these [roles] you have to learn, I don\u2019t know, fencing or baton-twirling or something like that. Now I know my way around a film camera, which is really useful.\u201d Learning the intricacies of working a camera may have even become a new favorite pastime for the Priscilla star. \u201cI\u2019m going through like 20 rolls of film a night,\u201d says Spaeny in the video. \u201cPersonally, it\u2019s been such a great journey.\u201d Never miss a story \u2014 sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from juicy celebrity news to compelling human interest stories. Garland, 54, was \"very keen to have the photographic element accurately portrayed,\u201d according to Civil War\u2019s still photographer Murray Close, who says he was instructed to \u201cwork with Kirsten and with Cailee to get them to understand photography.\u201d \u201cIn movies sometimes people don\u2019t hold the cameras well,\u201d adds Close. \u201cYou can tell immediately they\u2019re not photographers, they\u2019re just acting.\u201d The Annihilation director\u2019s commitment to accuracy throughout filming paid off. Following its April 12 release, Civil War became distributor A24's second highest-grossing film (after 2022\u2019s Everything Everywhere All at Once) and earned positive reviews from critics and audiences alike. Civil War is on 4K UHD, Blu-ray, DVD and digital now.",

        "text": "An Ohio woman in need of a kidney transplant has found her donor in one of her oldest friends: a sorority sister she's known for 18 years. Jessica Hause has gone viral on TikTok for sharing the emotional moment her longtime friend Megan Schultz told her that she was a match. In the video, 37-year-old Hause can be seen answering a video call while Schultz tells her the news. \"I have some exciting news for you,\" Schultz says. \"I am a match!\" Never miss a story \u2014 sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories. Hause, clearly in shock, then opens her eyes wide and covers her face in amazement. \"No, Megan, you're not \u2014 you are?\" Hause says in disbelief. \"Yes, and I've been through all the testing and everything,\" she responds. As the two then both begin to cry, Schultz says, \"I am so excited to be able to do this for you, Jess.\" Speaking to PEOPLE in an exclusive interview, Hause says she was diagnosed with Chronic Kidney Disease in September 2023, while she was living In Charlotte, North Carolina. \"My parents live in Ohio so they had to help me move back home since I would need care,\" she says. \"I started dialysis immediately when I was diagnosed and have been going three to four times a week for 3.5 hours at a time.\" Once she became eligible to get on the transplant list in January, she shared a post on Instagram letting people know she was looking for a live donor. \"Then weekly, I would make a Reel showing people a glimpse into what my life now looked like, and what a week as a young dialysis patient was like,\" Hause says. That schedule included dialysis in the morning followed by a five-mile walk and several pilates workouts before cooking dinner. \"At that point I still had to do a marathon of testing to even see if I would be accepted on the list,\" Hause adds. \"I kept posting consistently to make people aware of organ donation and what a massive shortage there is. There are about 15 or more tests and appointments you have to clear to be put on the list \u2014anything from a mammogram to dental exams. They literally check you from head to toe to make sure your body can withstand a major surgery.\" The final step is a surgeons conference, Hause explains, where a team of doctors determines whether or not to put a potential organ transplant recipient on the list to receive the organ. Hause was officially placed on the list on April 22. Less than two months later, on June 13, she got the FaceTime call from her old sorority sister. Hause calls Schultz her \"donor, hero and angel,\" and says she is \"still in shock\" after receiving the phone call. \"[She is] the one who is saving my life,\" Hause says, noting that the two met in college at Ohio State University 18 years ago, when both pledged Pi Beta Phi. \"We lived together in college, we traveled to Bowl games together and no matter the distance we\u2019ve always stayed friends,\" says Hause of Schultz, who lives in Columbus, Ohio, with her husband and works as an attorney. \"She has always been the sweetest, most kind soul, doesn\u2019t have an enemy and we had such a blast in college. She\u2019s brave, loyal and so selfless. She stepped up when not a lot of other people would and I believe God put her in my life for this exact reason,\" Hause says. The gift of Schultz's kidney, Hause says, \"means getting a second chance at life.\" With surgery set for Nov. 12, Hause and Schultz plan to recover together for five to six days in the hospital following the procedures. Then, Hause says, she plans to move to Columbus herself, so she can make memories with her friend \"for years to come.\" \"It\u2019s bigger than anything I can ever fathom,\" she says. \"The courage she has is remarkable. She\u2019s the type of person everyone should aspire to be like, and the type of friend everyone needs. This is life changing for me ... this is my new beginning.\"",

The show promises to go \"all in with the top receivers in the league,\" according to Moss, as the receivers \"balance their daily grind with the pursuit of greatness.\" Netflix released Quarterback, which followed Kansas City Chiefs star Patrick Mahomes, Kirk Cousins from the Minnesota Vikings and Marcus Mariota (formerly of the Atlanta Falcons) in 2023. Mahomes, 28, through his 2PM Productions company, serves as an executive producer on Receiver, alongside NFL Films and Manning's Omaha Productions.

The pop star, 39, opened up about how she got \"petty\" revenge on a celebrity \u2014 which took place while she was staying at Elton John's home in France \u2014 during a recent episode of her Miss Me? podcast. \u201cThis was when I was managed by Elton John\u2019s company and I\u2019d been sent to his house in the south of France to like dry out for a couple of weeks,\u201d Allen said during the episode. She continued: \u201cAnd while I was there I got a phone call from somebody very famous at the time asking me if I could perform at a charity event that they were involved in she was asking me to sing a song with her boyfriend, who was a musician.\" Allen ended up telling the person she'd \"love to\" but since it was next week, she didn't have time to rehearse \"because I'm in the south of France.\" \u201cShe was like, \u2018Don\u2019t worry, we\u2019ll come out there and we\u2019ll rehearse with you,'\" Allen recalled of the conversation with the celebrity. The \"Smile\" singer continued: \u201cThey come to the South of France, they arrive, and it\u2019s like late afternoon and she\u2019s like, \u2018I think you guys should sing [Simon & Garfunkel\u2019s] \u2018The Sound Of Silence\u2019. And I was like, \u2018Ooh, I don\u2019t know about that, I really don\u2019t want to \u2013 that\u2019s out of my comfort zone\u2019. And she got the right hump.\u201d Instead, Allen suggested doing \"Somethin' Stupid' by Frank and Nancy Sinatra and said she'd go downstairs with the artist to practice. The musician's famous girlfriend \"grabbed my arm and she said, \u2018If you think I\u2019m leaving you alone with my f---ing boyfriend you\u2019ve got another thing coming.\u2019\" The \"Not Fair\" musician said, \"I was on my own in this house and it was the two of them and just me, and she was quite a lot older than me, and a lot more famous and more successful, and I just thought, \u2018I\u2019m stranded and you\u2019ve got me snookered.\u2019\" \u201cHer boyfriend was not someone I found remotely attractive and she was incredibly beautiful \u2013 still is \u2013 and so should not have found me remotely a threat,\" Allen noted. Then, the \"LDN\" performer revealed how she got revenge on the A-lister, which entailed insisting she present Allen with an award near the end of the event. \u201cI was like, \u2018There is no way this person will be able to hold themselves together for that long and if I can stay sober then she\u2019ll have to present me with the award when I\u2019m looking pristine and brilliant and she looks completely f---ed.\u2019 And it f---ing worked,\" Allen said. She added: \"Front cover of the papers the next day were like, \u2018So and so was a complete mess,\u2019 and then pictures of me with my award,\" Despite her act of retribution, Allen does \"really like\" the mystery celebrity. She continued: \u201cIt was just a particularly bad phase that both of us were going through at the time. All is forgiven on my part anyway. But she\u2019s probably just finding out.

The British pop star was once a client of a management company owned by John but was dropped from the roster in 2014, around the time she went through a divorce and struggled with substance abuse, At the time, Allen sent John a \"vulnerable\" letter expressing her grievances and was offended when she never received a response. However, she never actually sent the note. \"I was quite cross with him for a few years for not having responded to this letter because I\u2019d been very vulnerable and open, and I thought it was mean of him, actually,\" she said. But when she moved to America and was unpacking, Allen found it and realized she never sent it.",

We\u2019re talking Fro-Secco for summer and icy Prosecco Pops and more. The enterprise \u2014 which includes a cocktail blog, Join Jules, as well as TikTok, Instagram and YouTube \u2014 has since become a family project. Her sister, Lucianna, takes photos, while McIntosh and her uncle, Brad Sutton, cohost The Art of Drinking podcast. McIntosh\u2019s debut cocktail cookbook, \u201cPretty Simple Cocktails\u201d (Clarkson Potter, $25), will hit bookstore shelves on July 23. We recently chatted with her to learn more. Q. What inspired you to start @join_jules? A. Online, there weren\u2019t a lot of recipes that felt approachable and attainable \u2014 and were not going to break my budget. I\u2019m not going to go buy this antique vermouth to make an insane Negroni. I felt like there was a need for something that was a little bit easier. I also felt like there needed to be beautiful drinks out there, and I didn\u2019t see too many. I want to have a pretty little drink in front of me that is beautifully garnished and tastes great. That\u2019s why I started posting. Q. There\u2019s a seasonality element here too, isn\u2019t there? A. A lot of this stemmed from how I was raised. My family\u2019s been farming in Northern California for over 100 years, so I grew up knowing when cherries were in season, or when they were harvesting walnuts \u2014 because my allergies were terrible. Making approachable drinks doesn\u2019t mean you have to buy top-shelf spirits. You can use fresh seasonal produce \u2014 it\u2019s cheaper when you buy seasonally, it tastes better, and it\u2019s easy to whip up at home. Q. What audience were you aiming for? A. I wanted it to be the starting place for people who want to get into home bartending. One of my favorite parts of the book is in the \u201cTools\u201d section, where we have an \u201cIn a Pinch\u201d section. Say you\u2019re at an Airbnb or don\u2019t want to commit to buying all this gear \u2014 you can use a mason jar instead of a cocktail shaker. I just want people to get excited about their beverage-making and not feel intimidated. Q. Tell me about your background and your connections to the food and beverage world\u2026 A. I always said that I was never going to be like my mother, but here I am. My mom has a cooking show called \u201cBringing it Home with Laura McIntosh\u201d on PBS, and she has been doing that ever since I can remember. She covers food, but most importantly, she covers the farmers behind our food. She would go into the fields, bring a local chef from the area and highlight a different commodity each episode. I also have to take my hat off to my uncle. When I had this budding interest in cocktails \u2014 I loved going to happy hour with my friends \u2014 he was the one who taught me the science behind it and (how) to save money by making it myself. Q. How have people responded? A. In the beginning, it really was a community, where we would all collaborate along the way. Professional bartenders would comment and say \u201cHey, when you do an egg white cocktail, don\u2019t serve it over an ice cube.\u201d My followers and I would read that, and we would all learn together. It showed me that people wanted to know how to do this, but there wasn\u2019t someone that they felt comfortable asking questions, or who they saw making mistakes, correcting them and being okay with doing something wrong. A lot of times on social media, people feel like they have to be perfect. I think a lot of people gravitated towards the fact that we aren\u2019t perfect, and we are going to make mistakes, but at the end of the day, we\u2019re making cocktails. It doesn\u2019t have to be rocket science. People want to make fun drinks, and they want to serve their guests fun drinks, whether they contain alcohol or not. Q. What\u2019s your process for developing a new cocktail? A. I start by going to the farmers market or my grocery store. I don\u2019t have a recipe. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing. I just go in and see what\u2019s out there and what\u2019s in season \u2014 and from there, I get inspired. This week, I did a whole Cherry Week, taking inspiration from spirits that go with cherries. For me, it\u2019s about taking what\u2019s in season and understanding the makeup of a classic cocktail. Once you understand that, you can really start to plug and chug. That\u2019s how I started, and it\u2019s how I think a lot of people should start when they make cocktails. Once you know how to make a cocktail the right way, like an Old Fashioned or a classic Margarita, then you can start playing with what\u2019s in season. Once you\u2019ve really gone through the book, it\u2019s my hope that people can then riff on the recipes with their own seasonal substitutions. Q. Parting thoughts? A. Be okay with making mistakes. Garnish the cocktails \u2014 because we deserve it. And have fun creating happy hour. Details: Pretty Simple Cocktails (Clarkson Potter, $25) hits bookstores July 23.",

        "text": "WASHINGTON -- Leaders of NATO countries gathered on July 9 in Washington for a summit to discuss ways to bolster the alliance's defense capabilities and support Ukraine against the backdrop of political uncertainty in the host country and Russia's intense bombing of Ukraine, whose leader arrived at midday to press Kyiv's needs. NATO is expected to announce plans for European members to boost spending on weapons and ammunition procurement following years of underinvestment as well as a 40 billion-euro ($43 billion) aid package for Ukraine. The agenda of the three-day summit, which will mark NATO's 75th anniversary, will be partially overshadowed by concerns about U.S. President Joe Biden's age and ability to lead after his chances of winning reelection this November took a hit following his dismal debate performance against Republican contender Donald Trump last month. Support and aid to Ukraine is likely to take on even greater immediacy at the summit following one of the worst Russian air attacks on the country since the Kremlin launched the full-scale invasion in February 2022. The barrage of missiles fired across Ukraine on July 8 struck several civilian facilities, including Kyiv's Okhmatdyt Children's Hospital, killing at least 41 people in total and injuring scores more in what Biden called a \"horrific reminder of Russia's brutality.\" Michael Carpenter, senior director for NATO at the National Security Council, told reporters on July 8 that the allies will announce new measures to bolster Ukraine's security, including air defense and F-16 fighter jets, but he did not give any details. A senior NATO official, briefing reporters on condition of anonymity, said that despite dwindling resources, Russia would likely be able to maintain its war economy for three to four years. However, the official added that the Kremlin lacked the munitions and troops to launch a major offensive against Ukraine in the near term. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has for months pleaded with NATO members for more air defense, especially the U.S.-made Patriot missile system, to defend its troops, cities, and infrastructure against large-scale Russian bombing campaigns. Upon arriving at the summit and ahead of his expected speech later on July 9, Zelenskiy said he would also press for NATO commitments on additional warplanes and to provide enhanced security guarantees. In a video posted on his Telegram account, Zelenskiy said: \"We are fighting for additional security guarantees for Ukraine. And these consist of weapons and finances, political support.\" \"We are doing, and will always do everything, to make the Russian terrorist lose,\" he added. The alliance will also announce a new NATO military command in Germany to coordinate the training and equipping of Ukrainian troops and station a senior NATO representative in Kyiv. However, the summit will not extend an invitation for Ukraine to join the alliance. Carpenter said there was still no consensus on the issue among the 32 allies. The NATO communique is expected to say that Ukraine belongs in the alliance without giving a time frame for when it will join. NATO members also couldn't agree on a multiyear military aid package for Ukraine that outgoing Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg had proposed. Instead, NATO will announce a one-year, 40 billion-euro package. Biden and Zelenskiy will meet on July 11 and be joined by the leaders of about two dozen other countries that have signed bilateral security agreements with Ukraine. Biden last month signed a 10-year agreement that calls on the United States, among other things, to help bolster Ukraine's military-industrial complex through co-production and joint ventures with U.S. industry. The expected announcements have disappointed some Western supporters of Ukraine who want greater aid and a clearer path into NATO. \"I don't see this summit doing much for Ukraine at all,\" Kurt Volker, who served as U.S. ambassador to NATO in 2008-09 and former special envoy to Ukraine in 2017-19, told the Center for a New American Security earlier this month. But Carpenter said the commitments made to Ukraine during the summit will show that Russian President Vladimir Putin's strategy of outlasting the alliance won't work. NATO unity on Ukraine, however, will be challenged at the summit by Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, whose pro-Russian views have irked the alliance. Orban, who just took over the rotating presidency of the EU, flew to Moscow last week without informing the bloc ahead of time to discuss an end to the war with Putin. The trip was denounced by Zelenskiy, the EU, and the Biden administration. NATO Spending Defense spending by NATO members will be another hot topic at the summit. NATO members committed a decade ago to reach a defense spending target of at least 2 percent of gross national product by 2024. Stoltenberg said that 23 of the alliance's 32 members will meet that target this year. \"One of the things you'll see at the summit, certainly behind closed doors, is that there'll be a lot of allies holding each other's feet to the fire in terms of defense spending commitments,\" Carpenter said. U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson (Republican-Louisiana), a Trump ally, said on July 8 that Republicans \"celebrate the peace and stability that NATO has secured...but we also believe that NATO needs to be doing more.\" \u201cEveryone cannot ride along on the coattails of America. And Donald Trump says this as bluntly as anyone. It\u2019s just right and fair for us to demand that others do their part,\u201d he said. The United States accounts for 68 percent of NATO defense spending. Some Western officials say 2 percent should be a floor, not a ceiling, and that NATO members should be spending 2.5 percent or more amid growing threats from Russia, China, and Iran. \"If we look into the future, and we look into fully resourcing our defense plans and preparing for all possible contingency, this will require for a number of countries to go beyond 2 percent,\" Benedetta Berti, head of policy planning in the office of the NATO secretary-general. Johnson, who spoke at the Hudson Institute, a Washington think tank, said Republicans were pushing for a \"self-reliant European defense industrial base.\" Trump harangued NATO allies when he was president for not meeting their spending commitments, threatening at one point to withdraw the United States from the alliance. Biden's poor debate performance and the specter of another Trump presidency has many European allies worried. But National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said the White House had not picked up any signed from allies that they need to \"be reassured of American leadership and President Biden's commitments.\" Strengthening ties with Asian partners to contain China will be another topic at the summit. NATO allies will be joined by the leaders of four Asian countries, including Japan, South Korea, Australia, and New Zealand. NATO members have criticized China for supplying Russia with electronics used in weapons production. \"The global threats and challenges we face, including from authoritarian actors and terrorist organizations, are all inextricably linked,\" Carpenter said. For Stoltenberg, the summit is expected to be his last major event before he departs the alliance on October 1. He will be replaced by Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte.

While speaking on the July 8th episode of Still Here Hollywood podcast, the Dark Knight actor, 68, told host Steve Kmetko, who asked him about his sister, Julia Roberts, \u201cYou\u2019ll have to ask her.\u201d \u201cI love my sister, but I can\u2019t talk about her,\u201d Eric went on his famous sibling, 56. \u201cShe don\u2019t want to talk about it.\u201d He then admitted that his daughter, Emma Roberts, had also \u201ctold me not to talk about her, but I stumbled and do.\u201d He added, \u201cI\u2019m not supposed to talk about either of them. But I do.\u201d Despite being told not to talk about his daughter, the proud dad \u2014 who shares Emma, 33, with his ex, Kelly Cunningham \u2014 couldn't help but praise the American Horror Story star's work. \"I'm in love with my daughter's work these days,\" Eric said while discussing people he admires in the industry, adding, \"I can't believe how great she's become.\" \"I'm so proud of her I can't see straight,\" he said.

And I\u2019m so proud,\u201d Eric said. While talking about whether he contributed to his daughter's success, Eric said he did \u201cabsolutely nothing. Except I gave her that name.\u201d Eric has had a complicated relationship with certain family members, including Julia, over the years. In a 2018 interview with Vanity Fair, Eric commented on his previous drug use leading to an estrangement from Julia and their sister, Lisa Roberts Gillan. \"I wouldn't characterize it as a falling out. I was crazy about my sisters. Loved them, adored them,\" he told the outlet at the time. \"They were precious to me, and we had times of great closeness.

Julia and Danny are also parents to Henry Daniel, whom they welcomed on June 18, 2007.",

        "text": "SEOUL >> A North Korean elite military training delegation has left for a visit to Russia, the North\u2019s state media said on Tuesday, the first military exchange between the two countries since their leaders signed a pact pledging closer military cooperation. The president of the Kim Il Sung Military University, Kim Geum Chol, is leading the delegation of military training officials and departed by plane on Monday, KCNA state news agency reported. It gave no other details including the purpose of the visit and where in Russia they were visiting. Named after the state founder, the university is a training ground for elite military officers, and the country\u2019s leader, Kim Jong Un, attended after studying in Switzerland while being groomed as the country\u2019s third leader. The military university delegation marks the latest North Korean visit to Russia as they exchanged a record number of high-level officials in the past year, including Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s visit to Pyongyang in June. At their summit, Putin and Kim signed a treaty on the \u201cComprehensive Strategic Partnership\u201d that included a mutual defense agreement which Kim said amounted to an alliance. The highly public development of the two countries\u2019 military ties worry officials in Seoul and Washington who point to evidence of weapons shipments by the North to Russia for use against Ukraine and believe Pyongyang may be receiving unknown assistance from Moscow. The two countries deny any arms transactions. South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol, who will be attending a NATO summit this week in Washington, warned Moscow of negative fallout from its friendship with Pyongyang on what had been an active economic relationship between the two countries.",

The former Bachelor contestant, 29, showed off her 5-year-old daughter Ruth's cooking skills in an Instagram Reel posted on Monday, July, 8, as she serves rabbit liver to her mom, dad Grayston Leonard, and brother Franklin James, 2. Ruth explains why she's cooking this unique meal for her family. \"Today we are killing rabbits for meat because it's not good for the earth to buy stuff from the store in plastic bags,\" she said.

The 5-year-old then gives a step-by-step tutorial on how to clean and cook rabbit kidneys on the stove. However, the most important step for Ruth is grabbing a stool to stand on so she can reach the stove in the first place. \"Got my stool!\" she exclaims as she climbs on top of it. Ruth then warns viewers, saying, \"Remember, when you cook kidneys, make sure you don't splatter them with a fork.\" \"Chef Ruth\" then takes the kidneys off the stove, picks fresh tomatoes from her mom's garden, and serves the meal to her family. While Martinez says the meat \"tastes like beef,\" Ruth has a very different reaction. \"I don't like them,\" she tells her mom, adding, \"They don't taste like sausage!\" The PEOPLE Puzzler crossword is here! How quickly can you solve it? Play now! \"Cooking with Chef Ruth: rabbit liver,\" the proud mom captioned the video. Martinez and Leonard are also parents to 9-month-old son Ernest. The couple welcomed their third baby together on Thursday, Sept. 28. Sharing a reel on Instagram, Martinez's two other children read a book titled The New Baby as they sit outside next to their newborn baby brother. The camera pans to show the infant as Ruth reaches out to touch their brother on the nose. \"Born on the morning of his daddy's birthday, September 28th ?\ufe0f,\" Martinez wrote in the caption.",

On today\u2019s episode of his Sirius XM radio show Andy Cohen Live, Cohen opened up about the few run-ins he\u2019s had with the former president while talking to Apprentice in Wonderland: How Donald Trump and Mark Burnett Took America Through the Looking Glass author Ramin Setoodeh. \u201cI\u2019m just remembering when Teresa called Trump broke on Watch What Happens Live and he called me at Bravo. I remember his assistant putting the call through,\u201d Cohen recalled. \u201cAnd he was furious at [Giudice]. And he was like, \u2018You need to do a retraction!\u2019 It was a whole thing.\u201d Cohen continued, \u201cSomehow I said, \u2018Listen, you need to talk to Teresa about this,'\u201d noting that he believes Giudice \u201cwound up posting a retraction or something.\u201d \u201cBut I remember him calling. He was really pissed,\u201d Cohen added. \u201cHe was very, at the time, sensitive about people saying he was broke. That was a huge thing for him.\u201d Despite their confrontation, Trump had nothing but kind words to say about Giudice\u2019s 2012 stint on Celebrity Apprentice when he sat down for his interview with Setoodeh. \u201cHe was talking about Teresa being on Celebrity Apprentice and how great she was and how he helped her find the charity that she did for children that suffered from kidney issues and how much money she raised,\u201d the author said. Cohen, for his part, did have some positive memories about Trump \u2014 whom he described as \u201cvery funny\u201d during their interview at a \u201cbig TV convention\u201d in Las Vegas years ago. \u201cI had met him a couple of times. I had never interviewed him. He never came on Watch What Happens Live,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cAnd it was a very funny interview because he was putting on a big show. So I think that was his genre.\u201d The Bravo staple also hosted \u201ctwo beauty pageants\u201d for Trump before he \u201cturned on him\u201d \u2014 which is why he fears the Republican nominee will target him if he beats President Joe Biden in November. \u201cI will tell you. If he gets elected, I\u2019m gonna stop talking about him because he keeps an enemies list,\u201d Cohen said, before joking, \u201cI think that I would be audited in the first year.\u201d",

        "text": "Tesla\u2019s model lineup has been very stagnant for a very long time. New models have shown up, diversifying the options on showroom floors, but the company\u2019s oldest offerings have remained largely the same since their introduction. The age of the Model S and Model X has clearly been hitting sales, but now Tesla is trying to hide that story with its sales reporting. Tesla has long categorized its sales as \u201cModel 3/Y\u201d and \u201cOther\u201d on its quarterly reports, using the introduction of new models like the Semi and Cybertruck to bolster the numbers of the flagging S and X. Recently, Electrek took a stab at parsing out those numbers to see just how well Tesla\u2019s oldest vehicles are selling. Survey says? Not well: \ufeffEarlier this week, Tesla disclosed 21,551 \u201cother models\u201d deliveries in Q2. As we previously reported, Cybertruck recalls gave us a good idea of deliveries in Q2. We put Cybertruck deliveries at 8,000 to 9,000 units last quarter. If we subtract those from Tesla\u2019s disclosure, it would put Model S/X sales around 12,000-13,000 units. That\u2019s 31-37% down from 19,225 Model S/X deliveries reported during the same period last year. A more than 30% decline in deliveries year-over-year is certainly significant. It\u2019s true that this omits sales of the Semi, for all the contributions that technically-extant model makes to the numbers, but it\u2019s safe to say that model won\u2019t change the results much. If we take the 12,000-13,000 number as accurate, how does that stack up to other electric competitors? Well, there\u2019s another automaker with an electric crossover and sedan we can look to: Hyundai. Looking at Q2 numbers for the Ioniq 5 and 6, per Inside EVs, the two models sold 15,172 units during Q2 of 2024 \u2014 a substantial jump above Tesla\u2019s numbers. This isn\u2019t the most fair, given the cost difference between the Ioniqs and the Teslas, but it\u2019s still an interesting look at what was once the It model in EVs is now being outsold by Hyundai.

The Gypsy Rose: Life After Lockup star, 32, \u2014 who, after years of being subjected to painful medical abuse, played a role in the 2015 killing of her mom Dee Dee \u2014 is expecting her first baby with boyfriend Ken Urker, 31. Blanchard shared the exciting news in a video titled \"I'm Pregnant, My Journey So Far\" posted on her YouTube channel on Tuesday, July 9. Never miss a story \u2014 sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from juicy celebrity news to compelling human interest stories. In May, the former inmate and Munchausen by proxy victim opened up to PEOPLE about rekindling her romance with Urker. While serving time in prison for her role in the killing of her mother, Blanchard was in a relationship with Urker, who first started as a pen pal. Urker proposed in 2018 and their relationship then ended years prior to her 2023 prison release. At the time of her release, Blanchard was married to ex Ryan Anderson, whom she married while she was in prison. \"Ken and I reconnected as friends. It wasn't like, jump out of a marriage and then let me meet up with you, and boom, we're in a relationship,\" she said. \"We had kept a friendship for the longest time. He was in a relationship. I was with Ryan, and so we were living different lives with respect to our partners, a 'wish you the best' type of thing.\" After her marriage to Anderson fell apart, Blanchard told PEOPLE that Urker is who she turned to. \"It wasn't until I knew that my marriage was over that I was like, 'I would like to see you and let's hang out because we never got to hang out before when I was in prison',\" she said. \"I would say that Ken is my first love because that's when I honestly felt like a mature love. It wasn't based off of a fantasy. It was actually based on a connection that two people have for each other,\" added Blanchard. In May, Blanchard's stepmom Kristy Blanchard told PEOPLE that Urker was moving to Louisiana, where Blanchard lives, to be with her. At the time, Kristy also admitted that she was the one who pushed her stepdaughter to reunite with her former fianc\u00e9. \"It's all my fault, and I'll gladly take the blame. I wanted them back together,\" she told PEOPLE exclusively. \"I made that happen. Put the heat on me.\" \"Gypsy will finally get her happily ever after,\" she continued. \"Ken's moving to New Orleans to be with her soon. He found a place. Gypsy is so excited to have him closer. A love like theirs comes once in a lifetime.\" Speaking with PEOPLE in December 2023, Blanchard discussed how she'd have to explain to her future kids about her time in prison, noting that she knew it'd be a \"hard conversation.\" \"We're in love,\" said Blanchard, who was still with Anderson at the time. But also, \"It's hard because I'm going into a new life and I'm newly married, and I'm going to have kids one day, and I'm going to have to explain to my kids why their grandmother on mommy's side isn't around. And that's going to be a really hard conversation.\" One thing she isn't worried about is hurting her children the way her mother Dee Dee hurt her, when for years she forced Gypsy into numerous painful medical procedures she never needed. \"Whenever someone says, 'Do you think that because of what you went through, you're going to do that to your kids?' I say, 'You know what? Absolutely not.'\" said Gypsy, who has gone through years of self-work and continues to receive therapy. \"I have learned what not to do. I have no concerns about my parenting when it comes to that.\" Gypsy Rose: Life After Lock Up airs Mondays at 9/8c on Lifetime. The season airs July 22 at 9/8c on Lifetime.",

        "text": "A white-shoe law firm whose clients have included Goldman Sachs, Google and Tesla will screen job applicants to determine whether they took part in incendiary anti-Israel protests, according to a report. Sullivan & Cromwell has hired HireRight, a company that specializes in background checks, to scrutinize pro-Palestinian college graduates fresh out of law school who are seeking a job with the firm, The New York Times reported on Tuesday. Job applicants who seek to work at Sullivan & Cromwell can be disqualified if they are found to have taken part in demonstrations where protesters utter phrases that are \u201ctriggering\u201d to Jews, according to Joseph Shenker, a partner at the firm. Sullivan & Cromwell will review news footage, social media feeds and viral videos to determine whether anyone applying for a job at the firm took part in protests. \u201cPeople are taking their outrage about what\u2019s going on in Gaza and turning it into racist antisemitism,\u201d Shenker told the Times. Shenker said that the firm, which employs more than 900 lawyers in 13 offices scattered across four continents, could disqualify a prospective employee even if they do not utter phrases that are deemed controversial. He told the Times that anyone who takes part in a protest where demonstrators chant antisemitic slogans were embracing a \u201cmob mentality\u201d and that they would be held responsible for comments made by others. Shenker said that the law firm will not interrogate applicants about their personal beliefs and opinions. According to the Times, Sullivan & Cromwell rivals are mulling the adoption of similar rules for applicants. The Post has sought comment from Sullivan & Cromwell. On Oct. 7, Hamas terrorists overran Israeli towns near the border with the Gaza Strip, killing nearly 1,200 people and taking scores hostage. Israel\u2019s military response against Hamas in the Gaza Strip sparked massive protests and demonstrations across college campuses nationwide \u2014 with some participants chanting slogans deemed to be antisemitic. In the weeks following the Hamas attacks, Davis Polk, the prominent law firm, rescinded job offers for three law students from Harvard and Columbia over their alleged connection to a letter circulating across the two campuses which blamed Israel. Another law firm, Winston & Strawn, revoked a job offer for a New York University law student who wrote in a student bar association online publication that \u201cIsrael bears full responsibility\u201d for Hamas\u2019 deadly attack. Rawda Fawaz, an attorney with the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) who was hired by a big law firm after graduating from Columbia in 2022, criticized the policy implemented by Sullivan & Cromwell. \u201cWhen we went through big law recruitment, we knew your social media better be clean, you better not have on there anything that you can\u2019t defend, you have to be a respectable person to be able to get a job at any of these places,\u201d Fawaz told the Times. \u201cThat has always been the practice. Why do you have to have a special policy on this?\u201d",

        "text": "(Tribune News Service) \u2014 Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi called on his \u201cfriend\u201d Vladimir Putin to seek a peaceful end to Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine, a day after a deadly missile strike on a children\u2019s hospital in Kyiv provoked international outrage. \u201cLoss of life leads to despair especially when children are killed,\u201d Modi told the Russian president in televised comments Tuesday at the start of their formal talks in the Kremlin. \u201cResolution can\u2019t be found on the battlefield, peace needs to be pursued through dialog and diplomacy.\u201d Putin said they discussed the war during informal talks over dinner on Monday, and he thanked Modi for \u201ctrying\u201d to find ways to resolve the conflict. Modi said their lengthy discussion yielded \u201cseveral ideas\u201d that left him \u201chopeful\u201d of a way forward, without providing further details. The Indian leader is on his first visit to Russia since Putin ordered the February 2022 invasion of Ukraine, and also his first bilateral visit since winning a third term in elections last month. His arrival in Moscow came after at least 38 people were killed and nearly 200 wounded on Monday in a wave of Russian missile attacks on Ukraine, including a strike that hit the main children\u2019s hospital in Kyiv. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy slammed Modi\u2019s visit in a post on the social-media site X, saying it was \u201ca devastating blow to peace efforts to see the leader of the world\u2019s largest democracy hug the world\u2019s most bloody criminal in Moscow on such a day.\u201d India has avoided censuring Russia for its war and abstained at United Nations votes on the issue, but has advocated diplomacy to resolve the conflict. While Modi\u2019s trip affirms longtime ties between New Delhi and Moscow going back to the Cold War era, it has drawn concerns from the U.S., which has sought to isolate Russia over its invasion of Ukraine. \u201cWe welcome people engaging with Russia about the war in Ukraine if they made clear to Russia that Russia needs to respect Ukraine\u2019s territorial integrity and sovereignty,\u201d U.S. State Department Spokesman Matthew Miller told reporters Monday. Senior Indian officials who didn\u2019t want to be named said in response to the U.S.\u2019 statement that New Delhi has always respected the UN Charter including territorial integrity and sovereignty. Modi posted photos of himself on X hugging Putin when they met Monday, saying he was looking forward to more talks \u201cwhich will surely go a long way in further cementing the bonds of friendship between India and Russia.\u201d Moscow has laid out the red carpet for Modi. India is a major buyer of Russian oil and military hardware supplies. Maintaining the relationship is a balancing act for Modi, as India is seeking investment and technology from the U.S. Washington is also aiming for closer ties with India, which it sees as a regional counterweight to China. Economic issues, energy supplies and manufacturing will dominate Modi\u2019s visit, as the two countries look to bolster the relationship, Indian officials said. Putin and Modi visited the pavilion of Russia\u2019s state-owned Rosatom at an exhibition in Moscow earlier Tuesday. Rosatom and India \u201care in talks to construct six high-power nuclear power units as part of a new project as well as developing low-power nuclear plants in India,\u201d according to the Russian embassy in New Delhi. The South Asian country will open two new consulates in Russia \u2014 one in the city of Kazan and the second in Yekaterinburg, Modi said during an address to the Indian diaspora in Moscow. The two countries shared a \u201cdeep\u201d and \u201ctime-tested\u201d partnership, he said. \u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P. Visit bloomberg.com. Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.",

Burt Shavitz\u2019s face and namesake covered the beloved beeswax lip balms and product line, which has always been linked to its founder, long before it was trendy to do so in the beauty world. But there\u2019s one name\u2014and face\u2014that\u2019s as intrinsically linked with Burt\u2019s Bees, though not as famous: Roxanne Quimby. \u201cEveryone automatically thinks of Burt as the unlikely face and namesake of the brand, but it's really Roxanne that made Burt\u2019s Bees what it is,\u201d says Mariah Eckhardt, VP & General Manager, Burt\u2019s Bees. \u201cIn fact, it was her intentional choice to put Burt\u2019s face on packaging as a counter to the unrealistic beauty standards being pushed by beauty brands. Her story is not your typical boardroom success story; hers is one of serendipity\u2014a mix of passion, energy and drive that led to something truly special. She, like Burt, left city life after art school in San Francisco to live as a homesteader, closer to nature in rural central Maine.\u201d Quimby and Shavitz had an unlikely meet cute. They met in the summer of 1983 when Quimby was hitchhiking home from her waitressing shift. \u201cI was hitchhiking to the post office and this was back when hitchhiking in a small town was very safe,\u201d Quimby says. \u201cWe lived in a town of about 400 people, so everybody knew everybody. I got into Burt\u2019s derelict pickup truck and we struck up a friendship. He was well known around town because he was a beekeeper. I was interested in him because he was so eccentric and such a one-of-a-kind person, and I was gardening at the time and living on the land. We both had a similar philosophy about a simple kind of life. He lived in a tiny little cabin, no electricity and no running water.\u201d The founders of Burt's Bees: Roxanne Quimby Burt Shavitz Courtesy of Burt's Bees Shavitz would sell his honey roadside in reused jars, and Quimby began helping him with his bees. \u201cHe was happy to have an apprentice because there's a lot of heavy work involved in beekeeping,\u201d she says. From his stash of beeswax, she started making candles, lip balm and other wax products to sell at craft fairs. \u201cI had an art degree, so I have a sensibility about aesthetics,\u201d Quimby says. \u201cI convinced him that if we were to sell the honey in more attractive packaging, that would probably be enough income to support him and me.\u201d MORE FOR YOU Apple iPhone 16 Pro Major Design Upgrade Coming, New Report Claims NYT \u2018Strands\u2019 Hints, Spangram And Answers For Tuesday, July 9th WWE Raw Results, Winners And Grades As Rhea Ripley Returns The now famous Burt\u2019s Bees Beeswax Lip Balm was inspired from a Farmers\u2019 Almanac recipe. People couldn\u2019t get enough, leading the brand to expand to New York City, Miami and beyond. \u201cIt grew organically,\u201d Quimby says. \u201cIt got to the point where I didn't need to have a waitressing job anymore. And it kept growing.\u201d Quimby helped drive the explosion of Burt\u2019s Bees through the 90\u2019s and early 2000s. Burt\u2019s Bees relocated to North Carolina in 1993, which had better infrastructure to grow the business, with Quimby as CEO, where it remains today, even after the company was sold. Even when Burt\u2019s Bees moved to North Carolina, Quimby maintained strong ties to Maine, eventually commuting back and forth. \u201cI had the responsibility of doing the right thing with money that I received from the company,\u201d Quimby says. \u201cThe right thing was conservation. I didn't want to get involved with all the toys that people buy when they have a lot of money. One of the things I love most about Maine is its beauty. Most of the state is still very rural, very woodsy and has beautiful coastlines, and I was in love with that. I started buying big parcels of land for conservation purposes.\u201d Rendering of Tek\u03b1k\u03b1pim\u0259k, Saunders Architecture Mir Quimby has been dedicated to that since her first land purchase in Maine in 1998. \u201cPerhaps her most notable legacy stems from the choice in the 90s to put profits from the business towards land purchases in Maine,\u201d Eckhardt says. \u201cShe bought thousands of acres of Maine logging sites and envisioned a new national park in the Maine North Woods. The fact that she saw that vision through to build toward Katahdin Woods & Waters National Monument is incredible.\u201d Quimby was inspired by essays of naturalists, like Thoreau, who spent time in the north Maine woods. She even used the brand\u2019s catalog to promote the idea of a Maine woods national park, encouraging Burt\u2019s Bees\u2019 customers to get involved directly. In 2016, Roxanne donated 87,500 acres of Maine\u2019s North Woods to be designated and federally protected as Katahdin Woods and Waters National Monument, which was created through Presidential Proclamation. The Burt\u2019s Bees corporate team reconnected with Roxanne at milestones associated with the Monument in 2016 and then in 2020 had the opportunity to provide support for a Visitor Contact Station there. Burt\u2019s Bees has invested $3 million in the Katahdin Woods and Waters National Monument\u2019s new Tek\u03b1akapimak Visitor Contact Station, with the grand opening slated for August 16. Tek\u03b1akapimak is a 7,900 square-foot building and 23-acre site located atop Lookout Mountain in Katahdin Woods and Waters National Monument. They will welcome the public through the worldview and artistry of Wabanaki people, as it was built on their homelands. The project is being developed in partnership with the Roxanne Quimby foundation, Elliotsville Foundation, a Wabanaki advisory board and the National Park Service. Rendering of Tek\u03b1k\u03b1pim\u0259k exterior, Saunders Architecture Mir The stunning building boasts unobstructed views of Katahdin to the west and exhibits that orient visitors to the monument, from its peaks, trails, rivers and wildlife to its uniquely brilliant night skies. Additionally, artists representing each of the four Wabanaki Nations created works of art that are integrated with the building architecture, landscape design and exhibition themes. \u201cThe site includes about a quarter-mile of paths following along the mountain's ridgeline, weaving through the forest and inviting visitors to slow down and reflect,\u201d Eckhardt says. \u201cAn Eastern Lookout and Gathering Circle is a focal point of the landscape design, with peaceful views across the horizon.\u201d Visitors can learn how they can explore trails for hiking, mountain biking, snowmobiling and paddling on the Penobscot River\u2019s East Branch. \u201cThe project is important to us because it will not only help more people discover this place that is so special to our co-founder, but understand it on a deep level,\u201d Eckhardt says. \u201cTek\u03b1k\u03b1pim\u0259k will serve as a cornerstone for educating future generations: visitors of all ages will experience the history and present of this place through a Wabanaki lens, while they will deepen their own relationship with nature and better understand the natural features of the monument. It is a project that is inspiring to those who experience it, and we're proud to play a role in that.\u201d Quimby\u2019s mission has influenced Burt\u2019s Bees long after she left the company. \u201cThough Roxanne hasn\u2019t been formally involved in the brand since its sale, her vision is a blueprint for how we operate\u2014by nature, for nature, for all,\u201d Eckhardt says. \u201cShe believed in ingredients from nature and transparently included a percentage of naturally derived ingredients on packaging. We\u2019ve continued this focus on natural formula standards today. Respecting and preserving nature has always been core to the ethos of our founders, and The Burt\u2019s Bees Foundation centers that ethos and has issued over $5 million to projects that preserve and open access to green spaces. We do our best to minimize the impact of our brand through our packaging choices. We use 60% recycled materials on average across our packaging and enable recyclability, while also seeking out new materials and forms to lessen our impact (like the paper tube our new Wild Blueberry lip balm is in).\u201d The limited-edition Burt's Bees Wild Blueberry Lip Balm Burt's Bees In a nod to the fact that Quimby acquired land with lip balm profits, Burt\u2019s Bees is releasing the limited-edition Wild Blueberry lip balm, which also pays homage to the brand\u2019s Maine heritage, since it\u2019s the state\u2019s official fruit. It comes a 90%+ recycled paper tube with double the amount of balm in a standard Burt\u2019s Bees tube and can be recycled with their TerraCycle recycling program. \u201cThe proudest accomplishment I've have with Burt\u2019s is to grow a company that uses natural ingredients,\u201d Quimby says. \u201cThere's a lot of personal care companies out there that when you read the labels, you can't pronounce the words. They're like 10 syllable chemicals. We were able to introduce to the public the benefits of real essential oils and botanical plant-based carrier oils like sunflower oil and almond oil, rather than petroleum-based oils. We grew a company based on that. We were influential in bending people toward a more natural, organic, plant-based lifestyle and at the time we started, which was 40 years ago, that was not so prevalent. We influenced other companies who also adopted those kinds of practices, so I'm very, very proud of that.\u201d Of course, Quimby is also fulfilled by the land she has acquired to share with the greater public. \u201cI'm very proud of creating a national park because it's an extension of the natural world that we put it into bottles and jars,\u201d Quimby says. \u201cWe are honoring our customers and employees by using the profits that were the result of the employees that work so hard by investing their money into something that is a benefit to the environment, and to the people who want to visit a national park. That really brings you satisfaction.\u201d Interior view of Tek\u03b1k\u03b1pim\u0259k with the \u201cWe are still here_ Welcome Desk,\u201d highlighting the talent and ... [+] beauty of carving and basket techniques adapted by a team of Wabanaki artists James Florio Today, Burt\u2019s Bees continues to champion the mission and vision that Shavitz and Quimby had when they established the company 40 years ago. \u201cWe are guided by those values, which matter to our consumers and employees and evolve to deliver against them, both in the delightful products we deliver as well as how we operate as a business,\u201d Eckhardt says. \u201cThanks to Roxanne, part of Burt\u2019s Bees\u2019 legacy is most definitely Katahdin Woods & Waters National Monument and its new Tek\u03b1akapimak Visitor Contact Station. Both enduring offerings, caring for people and nature. \u201cIt's that mutual care for people and planet that is inherent in Burt\u2019s Bees and that I hope will be our strongest legacy,\u201d Eckhardt says. \u201cHelping people think about what they put on their bodies, which ingredients are best, but also how they are sourced and the packaging is so important. Having a holistic view of the products we consume helps all move forward and we\u2019ve seen increased focus from business because people care and want better. Being able to make an impact through our supply chain\u2014supporting communities and ecosystems and thinking about the full life cycle of packaging\u2014these are some of the impacts we are able to make that ripple out. I also hope Burt\u2019s Bees legacy is about a better relationship with nature\u2014one where we take the valuable resources nature provides sustainably, and we believe in the ingenuity of nature to help us generate solutions.\u201d Celia Shatzman Following Editorial Standards Print Reprints & Permissions",

On Thursday, July 11, the actress makes her debut as Dr. Jill Gideon on Criminal Minds: Evolution in the show's season 17 midseason premiere. In an interview with TVLine, Huffman, 61, discussed what fans can expect from her character \u2014 the ex-wife of Mandy Patinkin's Jason Gideon, who was killed off-screen \u2014 who is a therapist. Huffman said that her character was \"deeply involved at the beginning of the BAU.\" And when Emily Prentiss (Paget Brewster) suggests involving her again, Rossi (Joe Mantegna) isn't exactly on board. Mantegna told the outlet there's \"a lot of ground we dig up, a lot of backstory to be told, involving Jill, my character, Gideon's character and with the rest of the people on the team.\" Huffman said that Jill \"airs her dirty laundry in front of sort of everybody\" during her arc. In April, PEOPLE confirmed that Huffman would be guest starring on the Criminal Minds spinoff as a \"brilliant biological psychiatrist who agrees to help the FBI's Behavioral Analysis Unit to investigate a murderous conspiracy theory.\" \u201cJill is reluctant to return to the bureau\u2019s elite team given her complicated history with David Rossi (Mantegna) and her dead ex-husband, Jason Gideon (Patinkin), but soon realizes her specific skill set could help them uncover another clue to the elusive Gold Star mystery,\u201d per the official description of the character. Her husband, William H. Macy, said that Huffman had a \"great time\" filming the role, and revealed that he \"went to visit her on the set a couple of times.\" \"I think she did a great job, too. I'm really glad she's working,\" he told Entertainment Tonight in May. Macy, 74, also shared that the longtime couple \"give each other each other's scripts and we give each other notes\" ahead of new roles. \"We somehow make it work.\" Never miss a story \u2014 sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer\u200b\u200b, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories. The role marks one of the actress' first major roles since her involvement in the college admissions scandal, for which she completed a sentence that included jail time, community service and supervised release. She appeared on The Good Doctor in 2023 and was supposed to headline a spinoff for the medical drama, but ABC ultimately scrapped the project. In May 2019, Huffman pleaded guilty to paying Rick Singer $15,000 to have a proctor change her daughter Sophia's answers after she took the SAT, and went on to serve 11 of a 14-day prison sentence.",

The European Council added that it still supported Georgia's move to join the EU if it can resolve the issue over the law, have free and fair elections and adhere to the principles of the alliance. \"The European Council reaffirms its unwavering support for the territorial integrity of Georgia,\" the council said. \"It reiterates its steadfast solidarity with the Georgian people and its readiness to continue supporting Georgians on their path toward a European future.\" Georgia's EU envoy, Pawel Herczynski, expressed disappointment about the decision to freeze $32 million in support for Georgia from the European Peace Facility for 2024 on social media. \"Other measures are being considered if the situation further deteriorates,\" Herczynski said on X. \"It is sad to see EU-Georgia relations at such a low point when they could have been at an all-time high.\" Dubbed by opponents as the \"Russian law\" because of its similarities to legislation used by Russian President Vladimir Putin to muzzle and shut down nongovernment organizations and the media, the law was vigorously protested with demonstrations and rallies. The ruling Georgia Dream Party, however, passed the law despite a threat from the European Union that it would cause the block to rethink its entry into the alliance.",

        "text": "Sharon Stone is doubling down on her support of Kevin Spacey. The actress spoke with The Hollywood Reporter for an interview published Tuesday, July 9, where she addressed some comments she previously made about Spacey, who's been accused of sexual assault. While she didn't specify which previous comments she was referring to, Stone, 66, previously told The Telegraph in May, in part, \u201cI can\u2019t wait to see Kevin back at work. He is a genius. He is so elegant and fun, generous to a fault and knows more about our craft than most of us ever will.\u201d In her chat with THR, Stone noted that \"people are mad at me for\" speaking out in defense of Spacey, 64, adding, \"I said that after being in therapy for seven years, not being allowed to work, losing his home, losing everything, he should be allowed to come back.\" \"He\u2019s reached out to everybody he\u2019s offended and said he\u2019s sorry. Kevin grabbed people by their genitals. Many people,\" she said. \"But nobody [has publicly said] he\u2019s raped them or forced them into a sexual encounter.\" Never miss a story \u2014 sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from juicy celebrity news to compelling human-interest stories. The Basic Instinct star added that she believes \"there\u2019s so much hatred for\" the House of Cards alum \"because in his case it was man-on-man.\" \"That\u2019s why he\u2019s not allowed to come back. Because he offended men,\" she said. \"But can I tell you how many men have grabbed my genitals in my lifetime? A lot more than Kevin Spacey has grabbed men\u2019s genitals. And none of them has ever apologized to me.\" Stone went on to say that she herself has \"been canceled left and right,\" but she's now \"back in fashion again.\" \"Here\u2019s the thing \u2014 I\u2019m a dark horse. I love dark horses. I don\u2019t want to be a white horse or wear a white hat,\" she told the outlet. \"And I get that not everybody thinks I\u2019m a good person. I get that people think I\u2019m difficult.\" \"But I\u2019m the person who wants to make sure you have water to drink and wants to make sure you have books to read and somewhere to read them,\" Stone added. The first allegation against Spacey came in 2017 at the height of the Harvey Weinstein scandal and the Me Too movement. At the time, Spacey denied the allegations, and came out as gay. The two-time Oscar winner's career also took a turn, with him being killed off on House of Cards and edited out of All the Money in the World. In recent years, others have accused Spacey of groping and similar acts, including the Old Vic in London finding 20 allegations of \u201cinappropriate behavior\u201d against the actor between 1995 and 2013. This past May, more alleged victims, including his estranged brother, Randy, came forward in Investigation Discovery's docuseries Spacey Unmasked. During his U.K. sexual assault trial in July 2023, Spacey said he was \u201ccrushed\u201d by the allegations and told the court he thought he was being \"romantic\" and \"intimate,\" according to BBC News. Added the Se7en actor, \"I lost my reputation, I lost everything in a matter of days,\" in regard to when allegations were first brought against him. In July 2023, Spacey was found not guilty of nine counts of alleged sexual assault in London's Southwark Crown Court. Other initial charges were struck out, BBC News reported at the time.

        "text": "SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) \u2014 Alec Baldwin\u2019s trial in the shooting of a cinematographer is set to begin Tuesday with the selection of jurors who will be tasked with deciding whether the actor is guilty of involuntary manslaughter. Getting chosen to serve in a trial of such a major star accused of such a major crime would be unusual even in Los Angeles or Baldwin\u2019s hometown of New York. But it will be essentially an unheard-of experience for those who are picked as jurors in Santa Fe, New Mexico, though the state has increasingly become a hub of Hollywood production in recent years. Baldwin, 66, could get up to 18 months in prison if jurors unanimously decide he committed the felony when a revolver he was pointing at cinematographer Halyna Hutchins went off, killing her and wounding director Joel Souza during a rehearsal for the Western film \u201cRust\u201d in October 2021 at Bonanza Creek Ranch, some 18 miles (29 kilometers) from where the trial is being held. Baldwin has said the gun fired accidentally after he followed instructions to point it toward Hutchins, who was behind the camera. Unaware the gun contained a live round, Baldwin said he pulled back the hammer \u2014 not the trigger \u2014 and it fired. The star of \u201c30 Rock\u201d and \u201cThe Hunt for Red October\u201d made his first appearance in the courtroom on Monday, when Judge Mary Marlowe Summer, in a significant victory for the defense, ruled at a pretrial hearing that Baldwin\u2019s role as a co-producer on \u201cRust\u201d isn\u2019t relevant to the trial. The judge has said that the special circumstances of a celebrity trial shouldn\u2019t keep jury selection from moving quickly, and that opening statements should begin Wednesday. \u201cI\u2019m not worried about being able to pick a jury in one day,\u201d Marlowe Summer said. \u201cI think we\u2019re going to pick a jury by the afternoon.\u201d Special prosecutor Kari Morrissey, however, was dubious that Baldwin\u2019s lawyers, with whom she has clashed in the run-up to the trial, would make that possible. \u201cIt is my guess that with this group of defense attorneys, that\u2019s not gonna happen,\u201d Morrissey said at the hearing. Before Marlowe Sommer\u2019s ruling Monday, prosecutors had hoped to highlight Baldwin\u2019s safety obligations on the set as co-producer to bolster an alternative theory of guilt beyond his alleged negligent use of a firearm. They aimed to link Baldwin\u2019s behavior to \u201ctotal disregard or indifference for the safety of others\u201d under the involuntary manslaughter law. But the prosecution managed other wins Monday. They successfully argued for the exclusion of summary findings from a state workplace safety investigation that placed much of the blame on the film\u2019s assistant director, shifting fault away from Baldwin. Baldwin attorney Alex Spiro replied, \u201cI\u2019ve never not picked a jury in one day. I can\u2019t imagine that this would be the first time.\u201d Dozens of prospective jurors will be brought into the courtroom for questioning Tuesday morning. Cameras that will carry the rest of the proceedings will be turned off to protect their privacy. Jurors are expected to get the case after a nine-day trial. Attorneys will be able to request they be dismissed for conflicts or other causes. The defense under state law can dismiss up to five jurors without giving a reason, the prosecution three. More challenges will be allowed when four expected alternates are chosen. And the judge ruled that they could show graphic images from Hutchins\u2019 autopsy, and from police lapel cameras during the treatment of her injuries.",

The YouTube account Pocketbook posted screenshots from Cox\u2019s OnlyFans videos in a 17-minute video titled \u201cThe Real Sketch: The Untold Story of Jamie Mar\u201d posted on Sunday, in which the YouTuber discussed Cox\u2019s past as a gay adult content creator. In the video, Pocketbook said he felt \u201ccomfortable\u201d sharing the information because \u201cbeing LGBTQ+ is not a career ender,\u201d but many commenters and social media users slammed the video and accused the YouTuber of outing Cox. Cox told his followers Monday he was \u201cliving under the threat of that coming out for two years,\u201d stating he was going through a \u201cdark time\u201d and facing addiction issues while creating those videos. Cox said if he had been alone while these videos leaked, he \u201cprobably wouldn\u2019t be talking\u201d on his livestream, stating his friends and parents \u201csaved me.\u201d Cox made jokes throughout his response, first telling followers he would address the \u201celephant in the room\u2026 I got a haircut,\u201d and joking he \u201cdid not have sexual relations with that man\u2026 I\u2019m just kidding, I did, possibly.\u201d Who Is Sketch?

The outing of Cox\u2019s adult content videos were slammed by fellow streamers and Cox\u2019s fans, who also praised how Cox responded to the situation. FaZe Banks, the CEO of the FaZe Clan online gaming organization, posted texts he had shared with Cox on Sunday night on X, which he said Cox told him to post. In the texts, Cox said he needed someone to talk to and Banks offered to call him a car to be with him. \u201cAll the FaZe boys were with him last night. Sketch was my homie yesterday, he\u2019s my homie today, he\u2019ll be my homie tomorrow,\u201d Banks posted. Banks\u2019 post was viewed nearly 30 million times. New York Jets cornerback Sauce Gardner posted on X that \u201cSketch handled the situation better than a lot of people would've,\u201d garnering more than 115,000 likes. Gaming streamer Co1azo praised Cox for his humorous response to the leaked videos, garnering nearly 200,000 likes on an X post in which he said he \u201clost it\u201d when Cox joked that the \u201celephant in the room\u201d was he \u201cgot a haircut.\u201d Barstool podcast host Dan Katz, known as \u201cBig Cat,\u201d posted on X that \u201cSketch is awesome and I hope he knows the majority of people, myself included, have his back.\u201d Chief Critics Cox\u2019s supporters and friends slammed others in the gaming and streaming communities who ridiculed Cox over his adult content. The streamer Sneako, who has nearly 400,000 followers on the streaming platform Rumble, slammed Cox for \u201clying about his life\u201d in a clip that went viral on X and was quickly criticized by other streamers. Twitch streamer Corinna Kopf, who has 3 million followers on X, slammed Sneako as \u201cincredibly dense\u201d and questioned why Cox would be expected to \u201crandomly disclose who they were f***ing\u201d after becoming an internet celebrity.

        "text": "Russia on Tuesday announced an arrest warrant for Yulia Navalnaya, the exiled widow of the late Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny. The country accused Navalnaya of participating in an \"extremist organization.\" A court said it had \"approved the request of the investigators and decided a preventive measure in the form of detention for two months.\" Little information about the charges was shared. Navalnaya derided the decision on social media, calling Putin a killer and a war criminal and saying he belongs in prison. Navalnaya \"was arrested (in absentia!) for 'being a member of an extremist community' by the infamous Basmanny court of Moscow,\" wrote Leonid Volkov, Navalny's former chief of staff, on X.\"Quite a recognition of Yulia's determination to continue Alexei's fight!\" he added.Navalnaya, an economist, stood by her husband as he galvanized mass protests in Russia, flying him out of the country when he was poisoned before defiantly returning to Moscow with him in 2021, knowing he would be jailed. Following his death, she vowed to take up her late husband's work and has lobbied against Russian leader Vladimir Putin's government from abroad. Navalny was a fierce critic of Putin and ran against him for the nation's presidency in 2017. In 2020, he was poisoned with the Soviet-era nerve agent Novichok while flying from Moscow to Siberia. He was transferred to a hospital in Germany for treatment. Navalny later told 60 Minutes' Leslie Stahl that he believed Putin was responsible for the assassination attempt. Navalny and Navalnaya lived in Germany briefly after his poisoning, and returned to Russia in January 2021. Navalny was immediately arrested and charged with violating the terms of a previous suspended sentence for failing to check in with prison officials while in Germany. He was sentenced to three and a half years in prison. His sentence was later extended by 19 years. In late 2023, Navalny was moved to an Arctic penal colony. He died there in February 2024, sparking global outrage and new sanctions against Russia. His posthumous memoir will be published in October.Since Navalny's death, Navalnaya has returned to Germany. On July 1, she was named the new chairperson of the Human Rights Foundation.",

The Girls alum revealed in a new interview with The New Yorker that she is no longer attached to Mattel's Polly Pocket movie, conceding that maybe she didn't \"have that in me\" to follow in Barbie filmmaker Greta Gerwig's footsteps in making something so distinct and unique to her. \"I\u2019m not going to make the Polly Pocket movie,\" Dunham said. \"I wrote a script, and I was working on it for three years. But I remember someone once said to me about Nancy Meyers: the thing that\u2019s the most amazing about her is that the movie she makes or the movie she would be making with or without a studio, with or without notes \u2014 that somehow her taste manages to intersect perfectly with what the world wants.\" \"What a fucking gift that is,\" she continued. \"And Nora Ephron, too, who was such a mentor to me, but always said, 'Go be weird. Don\u2019t kowtow to anyone.' And I think Greta managed this incredible feat [with Barbie], which was to make this thing that was literally candy to so many different kinds of people and was perfectly and divinely Greta.\" Want more movie news? Sign up for Entertainment Weekly's free newsletter to get the latest trailers, celebrity interviews, film reviews, and more. Dunham felt that \"unless I can do it that way, I\u2019m not going to do it,\" she explained. \"I don\u2019t think I have that in me. I feel like the next movie I make needs to feel like a movie that I absolutely have to make. No one but me could make it. And I did think other people could make Polly Pocket.\" Mattel Films previously announced that Dunham would write, direct, and produce a film about the toy line of dolls, with Lily Collins also attached to star and co-produce. A brief description said the story would follow a \"young girl and a pocket-sized woman who form a friendship.\" The brand is also developing a series of other toy movie adaptations following the success of Barbie, including ones centered around Hot Wheels, American Girl dolls, and Barney. A Mattel spokesperson said the Polly Pocket movie is still in active development when reached by Entertainment Weekly on Tuesday. \u201cWe look forward to sharing updates on the project soon,\" the spokesperson said. \"Lena is a remarkable writer and creator and we wish her all the best!\" From Gerwig and star and producer Margot Robbie, Barbie followed Robbie's title doll as she experienced an existential crisis and embarked on a journey from Barbie Land to the real world. Ryan Gosling played the unforgettable Ken to her Barbie. The 2023 summer blockbuster \u2014 which picked up eight nominations and one win (for best original song) at the 2024 Academy Awards \u2014 grossed a whopping $1.4 billion worldwide and became the highest-grossing movie directed by a woman.",

        "text": "South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol\u2019s participation in ceremonies marking the 75th anniversary of NATO this week is particularly timely, given that last month\u2019s summit between North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and Russian President Vladimir Putin reinforced the direct linkage between the ongoing war in Ukraine and tensions on the Korean Peninsula. North Korea\u2019s supply of munitions to Russia has helped lengthen the conflict in Ukraine, while a newly inked North Korea-Russia mutual defense agreement raises the likelihood of Russia providing advanced technology for North Korea\u2019s nuclear and missile development as a quid pro quo for North Korea\u2019s expanding munitions supply. The restoration of the North Korea-Russia strategic relationship following decades of dormancy will both embolden Kim to engage in bolder provocations toward South Korea and link inter-Korean relations directly to the Ukrainian battlefield. South Korea\u2019s national security advisor has suggested that South Korea\u2019s direct provision of military assistance to Ukraine will be conditioned on Russia\u2019s expanding technological assistance to North Korea. This statement includes implicit calls on Putin to exercise restraint in supplying advanced technologies to North Korea, but it does not respond sufficiently to the direct implications of a revitalized North Korea-Russia relationship for South Korea\u2019s security. The growing North Korea-Russia relationship represents a dramatic expansion of the scope of security risks that South Korea is likely to face from North Korea\u2019s unchecked drive to enhance its military capabilities. Not only has the revived North Korea-Russia relationship further paralyzed the capacity of the U.N. Security Council to implement a dozen resolutions condemning North Korea\u2019s nuclear and ballistic missile development, but it will also likely accelerate North Korea\u2019s ability to field a space satellite system and its efforts to develop a submarine-launched ballistic missile system, both of which would erode advantages that the U.S.-South Korea alliance currently enjoy. North Korea\u2019s acquisition of advanced Russian technologies would dramatically expand the scope and capacity of North Korea as both a peninsular and international security threat. Indeed, the envisioned expansion of the North Korea-Russia mutual defense commitment along the lines foreshadowed in the treaty represents a dramatic escalation of security risks to South Korea that also serves to directly link peninsular instability to the ongoing war in Ukraine. As a result, the Yoon administration must make the early curtailment of the North Korea-Russia strategic relationship a major South Korean strategic priority. These circumstances give added importance to Yoon\u2019s participation in NATO meetings this week in Washington DC because South Korea has an even more direct stake than before in the duration and outcome of the war in Ukraine. The immediate challenge Yoon faces is that Putin has already threatened actions that overstep the level of assistance to North Korea that South Korea has indicated would trigger the provision of direct military assistance to Ukraine. Yoon may want to pledge direct support to Ukraine for surface-to-air missile systems that enhance Ukraine\u2019s defense from Russian bombardments. This step may be particularly important as a signal to Putin that South Korea will not sit idly by as he revitalizes relations with Pyongyang. South Korea should also give priority to any form of military assistance beyond defensive systems that might help bring an early end to the military conflict. South Korea should also use the NATO summit to actively pursue diplomatic discussions on achieving a ceasefire in Ukraine, especially since a Korean armistice-style agreement has been mentioned by some analysts as a likely outcome of the military conflict. The purpose of such diplomacy for South Korea would be to generate greater political urgency around the goal of ending the military dimension of the war. Although South Korea is unlikely to play a decisive mediating or brokering role in achieving such an outcome, South Korea\u2019s interest in reducing the scope and duration of North Korea\u2019s munitions supplies to Russia provides Seoul with a strong motivation for pursuing more active diplomacy designed to support an end to the conflict. Yoon should use the NATO summit to underscore South Korea\u2019s resolve to respond by showing that it will not be intimidated by the emergence of Russia as a protector of North Korea while also curtailing the supply of North Korean munitions to Ukraine. This goal can be achieved through diplomacy aimed at suppressing Russia\u2019s demand for such weapons by supporting an early end to military hostilities. Yoon\u2019s efforts should mark the start of a stepped-up South Korean role to bring the conflict in Ukraine to an early and favorable conclusion, both at the NATO summit and through enhanced U.S.-Japan-South Korea diplomatic coordination.",

        "text": "The recently signed comprehensive strategic partnership between Moscow and Pyongyang is a worrisome development that makes the current situation on the Korean Peninsula more dangerous. As it is most likely a strategic blunder for Russian President Vladimir Putin, Moscow would do well to limit its negative fallout. Other stakeholders including Seoul, Washington, Beijing, and Tokyo also need to do their part to reduce the current tensions on the peninsula. What makes the Russia-North Korea partnership dangerous is that it contains a provision for a military pact that commits both sides to come to each other\u2019s aid if either side were to be attacked by a third party. This pact seems to amount to an official bilateral military alliance and a mutual defense treaty. The danger is that Kim Jong Un, the leader of a nuclear-armed North Korea, may feel further emboldened by this pact and engage in military provocations against South Korea. Even before the pact was signed, relations between Moscow and Pyongyang had become closer than at any time since the 1980s. This pact may add to the sense of security that Kim now enjoys. The backing of Moscow and Beijing could encourage him to take more risks vis-\u00e0-vis Seoul, Washington and Tokyo. If a historical parallel may be drawn, the current situation is somewhat reminiscent of 1950 when Kim Il Sung, Kim Jong Un\u2019s grandfather and the North Korean leader at the time, launched the Korean War with backing from Moscow and Beijing. Although it is highly unlikely that Kim Jong Un wants to launch a full-scale invasion of South Korea, there is a chance that he may feel emboldened enough to engage in limited military provocations. The danger is that such provocations could escalate into a full-scale war As any war in the Korean Peninsula will directly involve the United States, Putin must ask himself if he is prepared to go to war against Washington in order to bail out Kim from the consequences of his own military adventurism. If he is not prepared to do so, he may have something to learn from the precedent of Joseph Stalin, the Soviet dictator. Although Stalin gave his blessings to Kim Il Sung\u2019s plan to invade South Korea, he was careful to avoid getting dragged into a direct war with Washington as a result of the elder Kim\u2019s adventurism. Accordingly, the Soviet Union did not fight the United States in the Korean War except in limited air battles between U.S. pilots and Soviet pilots camouflaged as Chinese pilots. The just-signed Russia-North Korea pact is a liability, not an asset. It does not give Moscow any more than what Moscow was already getting from Pyongyang or any more than what it could get from Pyongyang without such a pact. Even before the pact, Russia was getting munitions from North Korea in significant quantities to support its war in Ukraine, and the pact apparently is not necessary for Moscow to receive other potential benefits from Pyongyang. Most importantly, Moscow needs to realize that whatever benefit it may receive from the pact is clearly not worth the risk of getting dragged into a war against Washington. Moscow has more to lose than gain as the pact has markedly raised alarms in Seoul, Washington, Tokyo and elsewhere. Policymakers in Seoul are very concerned that the agreement signals deeper military cooperation between Moscow and Pyongyang, including Russia helping North Korea advance the sophistication of its nuclear weapons and missile delivery systems. Accordingly, Seoul has signaled that it may transfer lethal weapons to Ukraine if Moscow gives such assistance to Pyongyang. Russia would do well to realize that South Korea is a major arms exporter and that the weapons South Korea can supply Ukraine will do much more harm to Russia than the harm done to Ukraine by the munitions North Korea supplies to Russia. Moreover, South Korea is economically much more powerful than North Korea, and Moscow needs to realize that, over the long term, it has much more to gain from pursuing good relations with Seoul than from pursuing good relations with Pyongyang. Accordingly, Moscow should do what it can to minimize the negative fallout from the pact. Moscow needs to assure Seoul that it will not let its relations with South Korea deteriorate unduly, and one way to do that is to refrain from helping Pyongyang advance its nuclear and missile programs. The pact does have an escape clause: The entire partnership of which it is a part can be abrogated unilaterally by one side via written notification to the other side. Moscow can hint to Pyongyang that it may abrogate the partnership if Pyongyang takes military risks that Moscow views as unacceptably excessive. Likewise, Beijing can echo such warnings by signaling to Pyongyang that it opposes excessive risk-taking and supports stability in the Korean peninsula. Lastly, Seoul, Washington, Tokyo and others need to do what they can to lower tensions on the peninsula, including pursuing efforts to engage Pyongyang in talks.",

        "text": "(Tribune News Service) \u2014 Russian tycoons received billions of dollars in dividends as their companies resumed or boosted payouts amid easing economic uncertainty over the Kremlin\u2019s war in Ukraine. At least a dozen business people gained more than 1 trillion rubles ($11.3 billion) for 2023 and in the first quarter of this year, according to data on dividends compiled by Bloomberg from publicly disclosed information. Many have close links to Russian President Vladimir Putin and include some who\u2019ve been sanctioned over the war that\u2019s now in its third year. Vagit Alekperov, key shareholder and former president of oil giant Lukoil PJSC, topped the list with about 186 billion rubles in dividends. He is sanctioned by the U.K. and Australia, but has so far avoided U.S. and European Union penalties. Billionaires Alexey Mordashov, of Severstal PJSC, and Vladimir Lisin, of Novolipetsk Steel PJSC, were next with 148 billion and 121 billion rubles respectively of dividend income. Mordashov is under U.S., U.K. and E.U. sanctions, while Lisin isn\u2019t under any major restrictions. The list also includes Putin\u2019s billionaire ally Gennady Timchenko and Tatyana Litvinenko, who received a stake in PhosAgro PJSC before her husband Vladimir was sanctioned by the U.S. in 2023. Vladimir Litvinenko is rector of St. Petersburg Mining University where Putin received a doctoral degree in 1997 and was the president\u2019s campaign manager in the city during three elections. The U.S. and its allies imposed sweeping sanctions on Russia in response to the February 2022 invasion, prompting many companies to pause dividend payouts on the back of uncertainty over a potential economic collapse. Those fears haven\u2019t been borne out as Russia\u2019s economy gradually adjusted to the new conditions and exporters found alternative markets. After contracting in the year that followed the start of the war, Russia\u2019s economy rebounded sharply as the government spent massively to expand the defense industry, shield domestic businesses from the impact of sanctions, and provide social support for families. Gross domestic product grew 5.4% in the first quarter compared to the same period last year. Many commodities exporters have resumed payment of dividends after reshaping their businesses and re-routing sales toward markets in China, India and other Global South nations that haven\u2019t implemented sanctions over the war in Ukraine. Many state-controlled corporations like Gazprom Neft PJSC and Russia\u2019s largest bank Sberbank PJSC never stopped making dividend payments as they racked up record profits during the war. Sberbank\u2019s shareholders last month approved a record 752 billion rubles in dividends for 2023. Still, Russia\u2019s economy may face significant problems in the second half of the year and in 2025 that may prompt the government to raise taxes, according to Chris Weafer, chief executive officer of Macro-Advisory Ltd. For many business owners, \u201cit is a case of better to take the money out now rather than risk losing it in taxes next year,\u201d he said. Companies face mounting difficulties over payments that may lead to shortages of industrial components and consumer goods, he said. That comes after the U.S. stepped up threats of secondary sanctions on banks in countries that Russia regards as \u201cfriendly.\u201d U.S. sanctions on the Moscow Exchange last month forced it to halt trading in dollars and euros. The Finance Ministry last month raised its estimate of the 2024 budget deficit to 2.12 trillion rubles, or 1.1% of GDP, from 1.595 trillion rubles. With inflation running at more than double the 4% target, the Bank of Russia may raise the key interest rate as much as 200 basis points later this month from 16% now. One more problem facing Russian tycoons is where to invest their dividends after sanctions compelled many to turn toward the domestic market. In May, private investors invested 116.3 billion rubles on the Moscow Exchange, a monthly record so far in 2024. Investment in Russian industries jumped 14.5% year-on-year in the first quarter to a record of almost 6 trillion rubles, central bank data showed. Still, domestic opportunities are limited. \u201cThere is simply far too much uncertainty for tycoons to make major investments at this time,\u201d particularly when they can get high interest rates from Russian banks on ruble deposits, Weafer said. \u201cFor most, the prudent course of action is to wait.\u201d \u00a92024 Bloomberg News.

        "text": "A court in Russia on Tuesday ordered the widow of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny to be arrested in absentia, part of a sweeping Kremlin crackdown on the opposition. Moscow\u2019s Basmanny District Court ruled to arrest Yulia Navalnaya, who lives abroad, on charges of alleged involvement in an extremist group. Navalny, the fiercest political foe of Russian President Vladimir Putin, died in February in an Arctic prison while serving a 19-year sentence on extremism charges that he condemned as politically motivated. Authorities said he became ill after a walk but otherwise gave no details. Navalny was imprisoned after returning to Moscow in January 2021 from Germany, where he had been recuperating from the 2020 nerve agent poisoning that he blamed on the Kremlin. Navalnaya has accused Putin of her husband\u2019s death and vowed to continue his activities. Russian officials have vehemently denied involvement in the poisoning and death. Her spokesperson, Kira Yarmysh, in a post on social media platform X described the court's ruling as a recognition of Navalnaya\u2019s \u201cmerits.\u201d",

        "text": "Ukraine has launched an AI tool designed to combat Russian disinformation and expose pro-Russian wartime propaganda.The initiative was set up by Volodymyr Borodiansky, former Ukrainian minister of culture, youth and sports. He said War of Words uses artificial intelligence (AI) to analyze thousands of hours of video content across Russian media.The tool, which is updated daily, tracks everything that has been said on Russian TV and Telegram channels since 2012. It provides users with access to a vast archive that can be easily searched.\"Every second, Russia generates hundreds of units of propaganda,\" Borodiansky said. \"Disinformation precedes all wars started by an aggressor country\u2014in Ukraine, Syria, and Georgia\u2014as evidenced by the analysis of information campaigns against each of these countries. Russia is applying the same means of propaganda against some EU and NATO member countries, who may become next on this list.\"The launch of this unique AI tool comes after reports emerged regarding disinformation campaigns against the EU. Fake news narratives are highly dangerous and can influence constituents' voting intentions during elections.Users can easily mistake videos on social media feeds for reality when, in fact, they are AI-generated deep fakes, and political figures are commonly targeted.A fake video circulated in 2022 that shows an edited Donald Trump claiming he had signed up for Russia's version of YouTube was shared by pro-Kremlin accounts online.Furthermore, a video falsely depicting President Joe Biden calling a draft amid \"an impending ground operation by Iran\" was viewed millions of times following Iran's attempted missile strikes on Israel in April. EUvsDiSiNFO, a project from the European Union that analyzes and raises awareness of disinformation, found that pro-Kremlin outlets targeted European Parliament elections to smear leaders and spread fake news.A EUvsDiSiNFO report stated: \"Russian officials sought to exploit the elections to fuel political instability, urging leaders like Macron and Scholz to resign. Other pro-Kremlin outlets sought to dismiss the elections by framing them as a referendum on support for Ukraine, predicting an imminent collapse of the West.\"The European Council on Foreign Relations (ECFR) also recorded a surge in Russian disinformation ahead of the election.Experts believe that Russian authorities are trying to manipulate and influence the public agenda by spreading disinformation on social media.Peter Stano, EU Spokesperson for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy told Newsweek that Russia aims to \"manipulate the public debate in the EU, sow distrust, and erode the credibility of democratic institutions and processes.\"\"One of Moscow's propaganda and information manipulation prime focuses is to undermine the public support for assistance to Ukraine. These campaigns focus, among others, on smearing and lying about President Zelensky and Ukrainian authorities.\"\"The Database of the EUvsDiSiNFO holds 17,000 concrete examples of pro-Kremlin disinformation/manipulation, around half of these examples (more than 8,500) target Ukraine directly or the EU's support to Ukraine.\"\"Russian authorities continue to conduct information manipulation and disinformation at a global scale using multiple platforms of the Russian state and Kremlin-controlled outlets, trying to flood and dominate the information space.\"Elena Simperl, professor of computer science at King's College London, said: \"While AI and generative AI, in particular, have been blamed for current disinformation campaigns by state and other actors all over the world, the technology is also used to debunk fake information, and the tool featured in the article is an example of what it can achieve.\"Professor Simperl argued that society is still unclear on how much disinformation shapes opinions and behavior.\"We have seen examples of AI disinformation in recent elections, and debunking can work, for instance, by labeling content that is proven to be false, but it is not enough. It needs to be complemented by deep research into how information is spread and how disinformation social media accounts operate.\"\"The biggest danger from all this is that people stop believing or trusting anyone or any institution, and that leads to disengagement from democratic or collective decision-making.\"The Russian government is investing huge sums every year to spread pro-Kremlin narratives domestically and internationally.According to Debunk, a disinformation analysis center, the Kremlin has allocated $1.6 billion of funds to propaganda.Borodiansky said: \"To effectively respond to Russian aggression, we have created a tool that will help policymakers, diplomats, the media, and researchers identify how Russia threatens the peaceful existence of the world.\"According to the website: \"War of Words is the only tool that allows the audience to conveniently and quickly find out what is being said about their country on Russian political talk shows and in the news\u2014in English and in the original language.\"Do you have a story we should be covering?

        "text": "Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi hugged Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday in a display of the two nation\u2019s strong relationship while most of the Western world condemns Russia\u2019s war against Ukraine. Modi\u2019s visit to Russia is his first since Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine in 2022, and he\u2019ll be one of the first world leaders among the United States\u2019s allies to visit Putin. Both Ukraine and the U.S. disapproved of the visit. \u201cWe have made quite clear directly with India our concerns about their relationship with Russia,\u201d State Department spokesman Matthew Miller told reporters. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky made his concerns more obvious. \u201cIt is a huge disappointment and a devastating blow to peace efforts to see the leader of the world\u2019s largest democracy hug the world\u2019s most bloody criminal in Moscow on such a day,\u201d he wrote on X. Modi spoke well of Russia during his visit and largely avoided confrontation outside of a moment when he alluded to a recent Russian missile strike on a children\u2019s hospital in Kyiv. \u201cAnybody who believes in humanity is aggrieved at the loss of life in war or in terror attacks,\u201d Modi told Putin. \u201cEven so, it breaks our hearts to see innocent children get killed.\u201d Putin seemingly sidestepped a straight response to Modi\u2019s concern, saying, \u201cI am grateful to you for the attention you are paying to the most pressing issues, including trying to find some ways to resolve the Ukrainian crisis, and of course, primarily by peaceful means.\u201d Russia previously denied striking civilian targets, but at least 22 people, including two children, were killed in Kyiv on Monday. India appears to be the closest world power to Russia outside of China. Putin made his last international visit to the country on Dec. 6, 2021, in New Delhi. He hasn\u2019t visited the U.S. since 2015, though has made trips to China each year since the Ukraine conflict. One of the main reasons for India\u2019s relationship with Russia is they are a major defense supplier for the country and share nearly $65 billion in trade. The meeting comes as the U.S. celebrates the 75th anniversary of NATO in Washington, D.C., where many world leaders such as President Joe Biden and Zelensky are expected to speak. NATO was originally formed as a measure to prevent Russia from invading, given the alliance would force every country to join a theoretical conflict. India is not part of NATO. Russia will likely be addressed at this week\u2019s summit, awkwardly for India, which is trying to maintain close relations with both the U.S. and Russia, who have a strained relationship due to the Ukraine war. The summit begins Tuesday and will finish Thursday. Biden is expected to speak on its opening day.",

        "text": "The annual cacophony over Sun Valley, Idaho, has officially begun as billionaires and business moguls descend to coopt the small town \u2014 population: 1,783 \u2014 for the annual Allen & Company Sun Valley Conference.Every year for more than four decades, just after the July 4th holiday, the sleepy ski town has hosted the richest and most powerful people on Earth, who show up to discuss the hot topics of the day. Sun Valley is where Jeff Bezos agreed to buy the Washington Post, and the seeds of an ABC-Disney merger were planted, for example.This year at the \"summer camp for billionaires,\" the Israel-Gaza war, the 2024 election, and artificial intelligence are surely on the agenda, along with rounds of golf and guided hikes.While an official guest list is not publicized, the private planes touching down at Sun Valley's Friedman Memorial Airport give us a preview of the shoulder rubbing to come this time around.Tuesday morning, the airport began experiencing heavy traffic hailing from tony locations like Aspen, Colorado, and Nantucket, Massachusetts, before the conference kickoff. According to the aircraft-tracking website FlightAware, over 165 private planes are scheduled to fly in throughout the day.Some private aircraft are associated with companies. Nike's Gulfstream G650 jet, for example, is on FlightAware's list and likely carrying regular Sun Valley attendee, CEO John Donahoe. Brokerage firm Invemed Securities has a Bombardier Global 5000 private plane scheduled to fly in, too, likely carrying its billionaire CEO and major Republican donor Kenneth Langone.Other notable names reported to be on the invite list include OpenAI's Sam Altman, Shari Redstone, who just sealed a deal to sell Paramount to Skydance Global, and Disney CEO Bob Iger, who is rumored to bring his potential successors along.Some may take a page from the book of regular Sun Valley attendee and Apple CEO Tim Cook, who has taken to chartering flights instead of using corporate planes to avoid jet trackers.Dozens of Idaho-bound charters from companies like NetJets, FlexJets, and Vista are also scheduled to fly in \u2014 the latter company Taylor Swift used to try to fly incognito to February's Super Bowl.FlightAware doesn't include planes using privacy protection programs set up by the Federal Aviation Administration to block their travels from jet-tracking websites that use FAA data. Sun Valley-goers Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, and Mark Zuckerberg, for example, regularly cloak their flights.However, these programs do not impact public websites like ADS-B Exchange, which uses third-party flight data and makes tracking celebrity planes flying to the conference still possible.Sun Valley's influx of private jets can be a headache for the small airport due to limited parking space and the congested skies.In years past, the airport spent months preparing for the increased operations to minimize the traffic jams. In 2022, The New York Times reported the airport had to accommodate over 300 flights compared to the typical 40 planes on a normal day.At the time, airport director Chris Pomeroy said that jets would sometimes have to circle the airport for over an hour, waiting for a runway to open.This year, the airport's fixed-based operator, Atlantic Aviation, which provides things like fuel and parking to private aircraft, has added a special event fee due to the increased airport traffic. A spokesperson for the airport did not respond to a request for comment.",

        "text": "Donald Trump's former lawyer Michael Cohen gave a stark warning Tuesday to Americans who are growing nervous about warning of revenge in a second term: it's no joke. White House correspondent and analyst Brian Karem spoke with Cohen for Salon, during which Cohen pressed voters to understand that Trump has already delivered on his promises to go after his enemies. \"When Donald Trump turns around and says that he's going to use SEAL Team Six as his own private force to incarcerate his political opponents, and the comment that people make is, 'You know Donald, he just talks stupid s--t. He's not going to do anything,' the point of the unconstitutional remand of me is don't discount what he's telling you,\" said Cohen. \"He's already foreshadowing what he intends to do. And when you say, 'That's not possible. He won't do it. He can't do it.\u201d He's already done it to me. It was a practice run.\" Cohen said Trump knows how to do it now, and he's not afraid to appoint people to help with his efforts. Recently he's mentioned plans to target former Rep. Liz Cheney (R-WY), who was kicked out of the Republican House leadership after she agreed to serve on a committee to investigate Trump's attempt to overthrow the 2020 election. Trump's former vice president, Mike Pence, became a target when Trump railed against him on social media on Jan. 6. The crowd chanted \"Hang Mike Pence\" and erected a gallows outside the U.S. Capitol. \"Why people want to ignore, when the guy is telling you himself what he wants to do, I do not understand,\" Cohen continued. \"It makes no sense. And this is what the White House needs to put forth to the American people: You cannot sit back and do nothing.\" Writing in his book \"Revenge,\" Cohen talked about life as a Trump target behind bars. The Department of Justice, down to a Bureau of Prisons employee, tried to force the ex-Trump lawyer to sign away his First Amendment rights to score his freedom. Cohen believes Trump was using the government against him to keep him quiet about the plethora of things he watched Trump do over the years. Now, as the election approaches, Cohen isn't afraid to admit that he's considered asylum if Trump takes office in 2025. Cohen told Raw Story that, after his lawsuit against Trump was dismissed, no Trump foe was safe. \"It's a terrible, terrible decision,\" Cohen said. \"This goes well past me.\" Journalists writing for non-state outlets in Russia and Hungary have been targeted or jailed. Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich has been in a Russian prison since March 2023. Putin has claimed he's a spy and not a reporter. During her Monday show, MSNBC host Nicolle Wallace confessed that Trump's promises of revenge are making her two-journalist household nervous about what could happen under a new Trump regime.

        "text": "Taylor Lautner and Taylor Lautner (n\u00e9e Dome) know exactly what gets on each other\u2019s nerves \u2014 specifically which household habits can bug them from time to time. During the pair\u2019s exclusive video interview with Hollywood Life, the Home Team actor, 32, and the registered nurse, 27, revealed their biggest pet peeves about one other while promoting their STEM\u2122 partnership and the new STEM Attracts & Traps Flying Insects Light Trap. \u201cTay\u2019s a very organized, clean person, and I\u2019m \u2026 not so much,\u201d Taylor pointed out, before Tay noted that her husband has \u201cgotten better\u201d with his habits over time. Tay went on to explain that she is \u201cjust very clean and [needs] things organized,\u201d adding that this is \u201cjust how [her] brain prefers things.\u201d Despite having different cleaning habits, Tay noted that she \u201ccan\u2019t be mad\u201d at the Twilight actor because, \u201cTaylor just doesn\u2019t really see it, which I\u2019ve learned isn\u2019t him ignoring it.\u201d Taylor also made sure to note his biggest pet peeve about Tay: toilet paper. \u201cI like the toilet paper hung a certain way \u2014 it goes over the top, not under,\u201d he said while the two shared a laugh. Despite the occasional complaints about their at-home habits, the spouses have been happily married since 2022. \u201cTay and I have been together for seven years now, nearly two years of marriage, and we had little bugs about each other that we certainly worked through,\u201d he pointed out, before explaining his and Tay\u2019s latest partnership. \u201cBut something that STEM is familiar with are bugs, and we have used [the] STEM [Light Trap] is our house before this partnership. \u2026 It is the most simple device. It\u2019s just a sticky cartridge with a UV blue light that you stick into your wall.\u201d The brand conducted a survey which proved that having insects and other bugs around the house can exacerbate feelings of annoyance between partners. Fifty-two percent of respondents even agreed that they are more likely to feel bugged by their partner while they\u2019re in the presence of bugs in their home. As Taylor told Hollywood Life, the pair have used STEM in their home before they partnered with the brand, and the Light Trap helps them be bugged by one less thing. It\u2019s an insecticide-free solution that uses a soft UV-blue light and refillable cartridges to attract and trap flying insects 24/7 including gnats, mosquitoes, fruit flies, house flies and moths. Since insects and other crawlers can enter their space \u2014 especially in the summers when Taylor admits he likes to leave doors and windows open \u2014 Taylor pointed out that he and Tay have STEM Light Traps \u201cin every corner pocket of our house.\u201d Aside from their latest partnership, Taylor and Tay have also been co-hosting their podcast, \u201cThe Squeeze,\u201d since early 2023. On their show, the spouses have invited multiple celebrity guests to discuss important topics, ranging from mental health to managing the overwhelming attention that comes with fame \u2014 which the MTV Movie Award winner has experienced in the past. While speaking exclusively with Hollywood Life, Taylor explained how he found a healthier approach to managing life in the public eye and his private life with Tay. \u201cIt has been a balance for me, but I would say I used to be way more closed off in private than I am today,\u201d the Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl in 3-D star said. \u201cI just think when things happened at a young age that it was just kind of a scary thing having so much privacy taken away. \u2026 And for me in the last few years, I think I\u2019ve found a healthier balance where you find joy, like genuine joy, in sharing moments of your life with people. So, I think that\u2019s actually been a cool journey for me.\u201d Tay acknowledged that seeing her husband open up on their podcast has been \u201cawesome,\u201d noting that she was happily surprised to hear him say \u201csomething he\u2019s never said before\u201d on the show. \u201c[It\u2019s] so cool that he feels safe enough to share that now,\u201d Tay added.",

        "text": "KYIV, Ukraine \u2014 Rescuers searched the rubble at a children\u2019s hospital Tuesday for more dead and wounded, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said, a day after Russian missiles slammed into the facility and cities across the country in a massive daytime barrage. The death toll from the strikes rose to 42, officials said. Zelenskyy said on the social platform X that 64 people were hospitalized in the capital, as well as 28 in Kryvyi Rih and six in Dnipro \u2014 both cities in central Ukraine. It was Russia\u2019s heaviest bombardment of Kyiv in almost four months and one of the deadliest of the war, hitting seven of the city\u2019s 10 districts. The strike on the Okhmatdyt children\u2019s hospital, which interrupted open-heart surgery and forced young cancer patients to take their treatments outdoors, drew an international outcry. The 10-story hospital, Ukraine\u2019s largest medical facility for children, was caring for some 670 patients at the time of the attack, Okhmatdyt\u2019s Director General, Volodymyr Zhovnir, said Tuesday. The missile hit a two-story wing of the hospital. \u201cThe building where we conducted dialysis for children with kidney failure or acute intoxication is ruined entirely,\u201d he told reporters, estimating the overall damage to the hospital at $2.5 million. Danielle Bell, the head of a U.N. team tracking human rights violations in Ukraine, said at least two people were killed at the hospital and some 50 people were injured, including seven children. The casualty figure would have been much higher if patients hadn\u2019t been taken to a bunker when air raid sirens first sounded, she added. Zhovnir said one of the two killed at the hospital was a female doctor who took children to the shelter and then went back to check nobody had been left behind Oleh Holubchenko, a pediatric surgeon at the hospital, was operating on a baby with congenital face defects. Despite the blast of air sirens, he and his team decided to continue with the operation. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t stop halfway through,\u201d he told The Associated Press. When the missile struck, the shock wave flung him across the operating theater. Shrapnel caused him minor injuries and pierced the infant\u2019s ventilator. The baby, still with an open wound, had to be transported to another Kyiv hospital where they finished the surgery. Authorities were working to restore the hospital\u2019s power and water supply as Kyiv city administrators declared Tuesday an official day of mourning. Entertainment events were prohibited and flags were lowered in the capital. Russia denied responsibility for the hospital strike, insisting it doesn\u2019t attack civilian targets in Ukraine despite abundant evidence to the contrary, including Associated Press reporting. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov on Tuesday repeated that position, pointing to a Russian Defense Ministry statement that blamed a Ukrainian air defense missile for partially destroying the hospital. Bell, the head of the U.N. team, dismissed that argument. She said an assessment of video footage and findings on site indicated the hospital \u201ctook a direct hit, rather than receiving damage due to an intercepted weapons system.\u201d The hospital likely was struck by a Russian Kh-101 cruise missile, Bell said. Ukrainian officials said the same. Over the past year, Moscow has been honing tactics to break through Ukraine\u2019s air defense, said Alexander Kovalenko, a military analyst from Resistance, a nongovernmental information group. Russia used a large number of various types of missile Monday that, arriving together, made it hard for Ukrainian air defenses to intercept them, he said. \u201cThey have been experimenting with different kinds of rockets since 2023 to find the perfect combination to break through our air defense algorithms,\u201d he told The AP. Russian forces have also programmed missiles to maneuver mid-air, according to Kovalenko, who added that during Monday\u2019s attack, a missile appeared at first to head further west, but then swerved back to strike Kyiv, Kovalenko said. The bodies of three more people were found Tuesday under the rubble of a residential building in the Shevchenkivskyi district of Kyiv, officials said, bringing the death toll in the single building to 10. The Russian onslaught Monday came on the eve of a NATO summit in Washington where alliance countries are expected to pledge new military and economic support for Ukraine. Russian President Vladimir Putin, meanwhile, was hosting India\u2019s Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Moscow. New Delhi\u2019s importance as a key trading partner has grown since the Kremlin sent troops into Ukraine in February 2022. Zelenskyy was deeply critical of Modi\u2019s visit, saying on X late Monday: \u201cIt is a huge disappointment and a devastating blow to peace efforts to see the leader of the world\u2019s largest democracy hug the world\u2019s most bloody criminal in Moscow on such a day.\u201d Meanwhile, Russian military and regional officials said Tuesday that Ukrainian drones targeted six Russian regions overnight, in what appeared to be a bigger-than-usual aerial attack by Kyiv\u2019s forces. Russia\u2019s Defense Ministry said air defense systems in five Russian southern and western regions \u201cdestroyed and intercepted\u201d a total of 38 Ukrainian drones.

        "text": "WASHINGTON -- Leaders of NATO countries gathered on July 9 in Washington for a summit to discuss ways to bolster the alliance's defense capabilities and support Ukraine against the backdrop of political uncertainty in the host country and Russia's intense bombing of Ukraine, whose leader arrived at midday to press Kyiv's needs. NATO is expected to announce plans for European members to boost spending on weapons and ammunition procurement following years of underinvestment as well as a 40 billion-euro ($43 billion) aid package for Ukraine. The agenda of the three-day summit, which will mark NATO's 75th anniversary, will be partially overshadowed by concerns about U.S. President Joe Biden's age and ability to lead after his chances of winning reelection this November took a hit following his dismal debate performance against Republican contender Donald Trump last month. Support and aid to Ukraine is likely to take on even greater immediacy at the summit following one of the worst Russian air attacks on the country since the Kremlin launched the full-scale invasion in February 2022. The barrage of missiles fired across Ukraine on July 8 struck several civilian facilities, including Kyiv's Okhmatdyt Children's Hospital, killing at least 41 people in total and injuring scores more in what Biden called a \"horrific reminder of Russia's brutality.\" Michael Carpenter, senior director for NATO at the National Security Council, told reporters on July 8 that the allies will announce new measures to bolster Ukraine's security, including air defense and F-16 fighter jets, but he did not give any details. A senior NATO official, briefing reporters on condition of anonymity, said that despite dwindling resources, Russia would likely be able to maintain its war economy for three to four years. However, the official added that the Kremlin lacked the munitions and troops to launch a major offensive against Ukraine in the near term. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has for months pleaded with NATO members for more air defense, especially the U.S.-made Patriot missile system, to defend its troops, cities, and infrastructure against large-scale Russian bombing campaigns. Upon arriving at the summit and ahead of his expected speech later on July 9, Zelenskiy said he would also press for NATO commitments on additional warplanes and to provide enhanced security guarantees. In a video posted on his Telegram account, Zelenskiy said: \"We are fighting for additional security guarantees for Ukraine. And these consist of weapons and finances, political support.\" \"We are doing, and will always do everything, to make the Russian terrorist lose,\" he added. The alliance will also announce a new NATO military command in Germany to coordinate the training and equipping of Ukrainian troops and station a senior NATO representative in Kyiv. However, the summit will not extend an invitation for Ukraine to join the alliance. Carpenter said there was still no consensus on the issue among the 32 allies. The NATO communique is expected to say that Ukraine belongs in the alliance without giving a time frame for when it will join. NATO members also couldn't agree on a multiyear military aid package for Ukraine that outgoing Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg had proposed. Instead, NATO will announce a one-year, 40 billion-euro package. Biden and Zelenskiy will meet on July 11 and be joined by the leaders of about two dozen other countries that have signed bilateral security agreements with Ukraine. Biden last month signed a 10-year agreement that calls on the United States, among other things, to help bolster Ukraine's military-industrial complex through co-production and joint ventures with U.S. industry. The expected announcements have disappointed some Western supporters of Ukraine who want greater aid and a clearer path into NATO. \"I don't see this summit doing much for Ukraine at all,\" Kurt Volker, who served as U.S. ambassador to NATO in 2008-09 and former special envoy to Ukraine in 2017-19, told the Center for a New American Security earlier this month. But Carpenter said the commitments made to Ukraine during the summit will show that Russian President Vladimir Putin's strategy of outlasting the alliance won't work. NATO unity on Ukraine, however, will be challenged at the summit by Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, whose pro-Russian views have irked the alliance. Orban, who just took over the rotating presidency of the EU, flew to Moscow last week without informing the bloc ahead of time to discuss an end to the war with Putin. The trip was denounced by Zelenskiy, the EU, and the Biden administration. NATO Spending Defense spending by NATO members will be another hot topic at the summit. NATO members committed a decade ago to reach a defense spending target of at least 2 percent of gross national product by 2024. Stoltenberg said that 23 of the alliance's 32 members will meet that target this year. \"One of the things you'll see at the summit, certainly behind closed doors, is that there'll be a lot of allies holding each other's feet to the fire in terms of defense spending commitments,\" Carpenter said. U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson (Republican-Louisiana), a Trump ally, said on July 8 that Republicans \"celebrate the peace and stability that NATO has secured...but we also believe that NATO needs to be doing more.\" \u201cEveryone cannot ride along on the coattails of America. And Donald Trump says this as bluntly as anyone. It\u2019s just right and fair for us to demand that others do their part,\u201d he said. The United States accounts for 68 percent of NATO defense spending. Some Western officials say 2 percent should be a floor, not a ceiling, and that NATO members should be spending 2.5 percent or more amid growing threats from Russia, China, and Iran. \"If we look into the future, and we look into fully resourcing our defense plans and preparing for all possible contingency, this will require for a number of countries to go beyond 2 percent,\" Benedetta Berti, head of policy planning in the office of the NATO secretary-general. Johnson, who spoke at the Hudson Institute, a Washington think tank, said Republicans were pushing for a \"self-reliant European defense industrial base.\" Trump harangued NATO allies when he was president for not meeting their spending commitments, threatening at one point to withdraw the United States from the alliance. Biden's poor debate performance and the specter of another Trump presidency has many European allies worried. But National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said the White House had not picked up any signed from allies that they need to \"be reassured of American leadership and President Biden's commitments.\" Strengthening ties with Asian partners to contain China will be another topic at the summit. NATO allies will be joined by the leaders of four Asian countries, including Japan, South Korea, Australia, and New Zealand. NATO members have criticized China for supplying Russia with electronics used in weapons production. \"The global threats and challenges we face, including from authoritarian actors and terrorist organizations, are all inextricably linked,\" Carpenter said. For Stoltenberg, the summit is expected to be his last major event before he departs the alliance on October 1. He will be replaced by Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte.

        "text": "For any couples thinking about marriage, Channing Tatum recommends tackling \u201cthe hardest possible creative project\u201d together, he tells PEOPLE. Tatum, 44, who appears in the new rom-com Fly Me to the Moon opposite Scarlett Johansson, has another movie debuting this summer: Blink Twice, a thriller directed by his now-fianc\u00e9e Zo\u00eb Kravitz, 35. Though they weren\u2019t a couple when they made the film, Tatum says the process was ultimately good for their relationship. \u201cThis is what I'll say about creating with someone that you are with or love: I suggest it,\u201d Tatum says. \u201cIf you are thinking about having a kid or if you're thinking about getting married, go find the hardest possible creative project with your partner,\u201d he adds. He says the key is not only surviving it, but enjoying the process as well. \u201cIt was so hard to make the movie,\u201d he says of Blink Twice. \u201c Probably one of the hardest movies that I've worked on\u2026 for a lot of different reasons.\u201d \u201cBut when you can look across the room or the set and know that you have the best person that is next to you trying to solve problems, and you're really looking to them for answers just as equally as trying to solve them yourself, that is unbelievable,\u201d he says. In Blink Twice, Tatum plays tech billionaire Slater King, who invites Frida (Naomi Ackie), a cocktail waitress he meets, to a getaway on his private island with a group of his friends. \u201cWild nights blend into sun soaked days and everyone's having a great time. No one wants this trip to end, but as strange things start to happen, Frida begins to question her reality,\u201d according to an official synopsis of the film. \u201cThere is something wrong with this place. She\u2019ll have to uncover the truth if she wants to make it out of this party alive.\u201d Kravitz, who co-wrote the script with E.T. Feigenbaum told Deadline in 2021 she had Tatum in mind when developing the character of Slater King. \"[He was the one] I thought of when I wrote this character,\" she said. \"I just knew from Magic Mike and his live shows, I got the sense he's a true feminist and I wanted to collaborate with someone who was clearly interested in exploring this subject matter.\" Tatum, who shares daughter Everly, 11, with ex wife Jenna Dewan, 43, and Kravitz became involved after they made the movie and got engaged in 2023. In April, a source told PEOPLE Tatum and Kravitz were \u201cactively wedding planning and working through all the details,\u201d adding that the two were \u201creally excited about it.\u201d Fly Me to the Moon, Tatum's other summer film, is much lighter fare than Blink Twice. In the 1960s-set rom-com, Tatum plays a NASA flight director overseeing the moon landing who butts heads with (and falls for) a PR exec (Johansson) tasked with filming a fake version of the feat in case the real thing goes awry.

        "text": "Scarlett Johansson dressed to impress at the premiere of her new film Fly Me to the Moon. For the Monday, July 8 screening in New York City, the 39-year-old actress wore not one but two stunning ensembles that scream summer. Johansson appeared on the red carpet at AMC's Lincoln Square Theater in a tan-and-cream gingham sleeveless crop top with beaded trim and a matching high-waisted skirt. A tiny sliver of her midriff was visible, revealing part of a tattoo on her rib. She accessorized the Prada look with simple circular earrings. The actress' hair, styled by David von Cannon, was swept into a chic French twist with face-framing wisps and added volume at the crown of her head, perhaps a nod to the film's 1960s setting. Makeup artist Hung Vanngo created a soft glam makeup look for the star, featuring a subtle smoky eye and a pop of pink lip color. On Instagram, Vanngo shared that he used products from Johansson's skincare brand The Outset to prep her skin before makeup. The Black Widow star changed into something more colorful for the afterparty \u2014 a bright orange halter-style satin minidress. She kept her hair and makeup the same, adding a small clutch purse. The PEOPLE Puzzler crossword is here! How quickly can you solve it? Play now! Johansson walked the red carpet with her husband Colin Jost, who wore a navy suit and blue printed floral shirt with a wide collar. The actress and Jost, 42, got married in 2020 and share one child together. Ahead of the screening, Johansson spoke to PEOPLE about a conspiracy theory that intrigues her. \"I don't know. I'm so not a conspiracy theorist. I'm like, I really believe in science,\" she shared. \"I don't know. I think probably that Dolly Parton has full tattooed sleeves.\" She then added, \"Is it real? We'll find out.\" Fly Me to the Moon, which also stars Channing Tatum, is inspired by the Apollo 11 moon landing and the belief that it was staged by the U.S. government. Johansson, who is also a producer on the film, portrays Kelly Jones, a member of NASA's marketing team tasked with rehabilitating the agency's public image. Tatum plays launch director Cole Davis.

In a previous conversation with PEOPLE, the actress described her character as a \"very modern woman living in a time where women were often underestimated.\" \"She uses that to her advantage and is always a few steps ahead,\" she said, adding that the film is \"totally original.\" \"It\u2019s not derivative of anything else, it doesn\u2019t follow a formula,\" Johansson continued. \"I think audiences haven\u2019t been offered a big-idea movie that is both funny and poignant and original in a long time, and they are hungry for that. The film is totally entertaining and fresh. I\u2019m very proud of it for its newness and scope.\"",

        "text": "By JUAN A. LOZANO HOUSTON (AP) \u2014 Many of the millions left without power after Hurricane Beryl crashed into Texas, killing several people and unleashing flooding, sweltered and fretted Tuesday as the storm deprived them of air conditioning, food and water in dangerous heat. A heat advisory took effect through Wednesday in the Houston area and beyond, with temperatures expected to soar into the 90s (above 32.2 Celsius) and humidity that could make it feel as hot as 105 degrees (40.5 Celsius). \u201cWe can handle it, but not the kids,\u201d said Walter Perez, 49, as he arrived early Tuesday at celebrity pastor Joel Osteen\u2019s megachurch in Houston, which served as a cooling center and distributed 40-bottle packs of water to cars that drove up. Perez said he, his wife, their 3-year-old son and 3-week-old daughter, and his father-in-law retreated from their apartment after a night he described as \u201cbad, bad, bad, bad.\u201d Beryl, which made landfall early Monday as a Category 1 hurricane, has been blamed for at least seven U.S. deaths \u2014 one in Louisiana and six in Texas, officials said. At midday Tuesday, it was a post-tropical cyclone centered over Arkansas and was forecast to bring heavy rains and possible flooding to a swath extending to the Great Lakes and Canada. More than 2.2 million homes and businesses around Houston lacked electricity Tuesday, down from a peak of over 2.7 million on Monday, according to PowerOutage.us. For many, it was a miserable repeat after storms in May killed eight people and left nearly 1 million without power amid flooded streets. Food spoiled in listless refrigerators in neighborhoods that pined for air conditioning. Long lines of cars and people queued up at any fast food restaurant, food truck or gas station that had power and was open. Damonte Oliver, 32, visited Osteen\u2019s Lakewood Church with his girlfriend and her mother. Their apartment had lost power for days after the May storm. \u201cI know they are trying to do their best to get everything back on. It\u2019s just a waiting game on how long it\u2019s going to take,\u201d he said before walking to a convenience store to buy cigarettes. \u201cI\u2019ve got to calm down a little bit myself,\u201d Oliver said. It could take days to fully return power in Texas after Beryl toppled 10 transmission lines. Top priorities for power restoration include nursing homes and assisted living centers, said Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, who is acting as governor while Gov. Greg Abbott is out of the country. Sixteen hospitals were running on generator power Tuesday morning, according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Beryl\u2019s strength at midday Tuesday \u2014 with sustained winds near 30 mph (48 kph) \u2014 wasn\u2019t expected to change much in the next two days. It was forecast to bring heavy rains and possible flash flooding from the lower and mid-Mississippi Valley to the Great Lakes into Wednesday, the National Weather Service said. A flood watch was in effect for parts of Oklahoma, Arkansas, Missouri, Illinois, Indiana and Michigan. A few tornadoes were possible in Missouri, Tennessee, Kentucky, Illinois, Indiana and Ohio, forecasters said. When Beryl made landfall, it was far less powerful than the Category 5 behemoth that tore a deadly path through parts of Mexico and the Caribbean. But its winds and rains still knocked down hundreds of trees that had already been teetering in saturated earth and stranded dozens of cars on flooded roads. Beryl, the earliest storm to develop into a Category 5 hurricane in the Atlantic, caused at least 11 deaths as it passed through the Caribbean on its way to Texas. In Jamaica, officials said Monday that island residents will have to contend with food shortages after Beryl destroyed over $6.4 million in crops and supporting infrastructure. ___ Contributing to this report were Associated Press journalists Jim Vertuno in Austin, Texas; Sara Cline in Baton Rouge, Louisiana; Jeff Martin in Atlanta; and Sarah Brumfield in Silver Spring, Maryland.",

        "text": "The tennis world was in a frenzy following a series of now-deleted Instagram Stories from Morgan Riddle, the girlfriend of tennis player Taylor Fritz, that many believed were aimed at fellow tennis star Alexander Zverev \u2014 and now, Riddle is clarifying that it was all a misunderstanding. The initial posts, which included videos of Riddle cheering on Fritz as he beat Zverev at Wimbledon on Monday, July 8, were coupled with captions that read, \u201cWhen ur mans wins for the girls,\u201d and \u201cCheer loud ladies.\u201d Tennis fans believed Riddle was specifically getting women to cheer against Zverev due to earlier accusations that he had assaulted his former girlfriend. Zverev has denied the allegations and a trial was settled out of court in June 2024. Following the immediate online uproar, Riddle posted a lengthy explanation to her Instagram story insisting that her posts were not what they seemed. Riddle began the post, writing, \u201cRegarding my stories yesterday\u2026 I took them down as soon as I realized the misunderstanding and how blown out of proportion they had become by the media.\u201d \u201cThey were not about anything that\u2019s happened off the tennis court & there\u2019s no bad blood between anyone,\u201d she added.

Following Fritz\u2019s victory over Zverev, the two exchanged a handshake as usual, but their lengthy interaction had fans speculating about what happened. Speaking with the press afterwards, Zverev said that he didn\u2019t appreciate Fritz\u2019s fans overly cheering for him during the match, saying \u201cthey were a bit over the top,\u201d according to the New York Post. As for Fritz, in addition to enjoying his Wimbledon win, he made it clear during his press conference that it was fair for Zverev to express his frustration over the cheering. \u201cHe\u2019s totally allowed to be annoyed if they were being annoying. \u2026 That\u2019s one of the things I asked him at the net, \u2018Who was it?,\u2019 \u201d Fritz said, per the Associated Press, before adding, \u201cIt\u2019s not a big thing. It\u2019s all good.\u201d Fritz, 25, told PEOPLE ahead of the 2023 U.S. Open that he and Riddle, 26, have \"very common goals\" in their relationship and individual careers. \"It's great that we can kind of work together,\" he adds. The American athlete and TikTok influencer have been dating since 2020, and Riddle often travels with her beau to tournaments. \"It's great to have somebody that can support you and support your goals,\" Fritz says.",

In fact, 27-year-old Tay \u2014 who was studying to be a nurse when she first crossed paths with the Twilight alum \u2014 says the pair's \"normal\" life may just be the most surprising thing about their marriage. While discussing the couple's partnership with bug killer and repellent brand STEM, Tay tells PEOPLE, \u201cI didn't grow up in the industry at all, and our day-to-day is still very normal.\" \u201cI remember I posted an Instagram Story of a bug in my laundry or something,\" she recalls, \"and everyone's like, \u2018Oh, my gosh, you do your own laundry?\u2019 \u201d Her actor beau, 32, interjects \u2014 \u201cLOL\u201d \u2014 before sarcastically asking, \u201cYou know what laundry is?\u201d \u201cGuys, it's very normal here. We go to the grocery store,\u201d Tay continues. \u201cThat would be a misconception for me, is we're just normal. We're just still doing the thing.\u201d Far less ordinary, however, is the peace the pair has found together. Taylor, who previously told PEOPLE that their first year of marriage was \u201cpretty smooth sailing,\u201d says not much has changed as they near their second anniversary. \u201cWish we could give you something juicy here,\u201d the actor says, and Tay adds, \u201cI know. I feel like we have such boring answers when it comes to it, but I guess no news is good news sometimes.\u201d And there has been plenty of room for bumps in the road. The couple, who co-hosts The Squeeze \u2014 a podcast centered on mental health and well-being \u2014 have been practically attached at the hip since they said \u201cI do\u201d in late 2022. Tay ventures that they have not spent more than \u201ca weekend\u201d apart, and Taylor echoes, \u201cYeah, probably three or four days \u2014 and that was probably pretty tough, at least for me.\u201d \u201cYou can see who the whipped one is,\u201d he jokes, as Tay pushes back, insisting that he just loves \u201cbeing around\u201d people. But, Taylor insists, \"I prefer your company.\" Never miss a story \u2014 sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories. The couple is gearing up to spend their most time apart yet, as Taylor is preparing for a lead role in The Token Groomsman \u2014 his first film since 2022\u2019s Home Team and his second since tying the knot with Tay. Costarring Sarah Hyland and Andie MacDowell, the rom-com takes place largely overseas, in Italy. Taylor first met Tay right before he flew to London for work, so the pair used long FaceTime calls as an \u201caccelerated way of getting to know each other,\u201d he says. But after that, he took a step back from acting, so they haven\u2019t had much time to master the art of a long-distance relationship. But, Tay says, \u201cI have more confidence in us this time around,\u201d adding that the couple\u2019s \u201cproblem is we actually like each other and still like to hang out all the time.\u201d \u201cWe're warming up to it,\u201d Taylor adds. \u201cIt will be a little challenging, but I have faith deep somewhere.\u201d",

During an appearance on the Tuesday, July 9 episode of Live with Kelly and Mark, the Real Housewives of New Jersey star addressed her recent social media mishap that turned into a viral sensation. Over the weekend, the 52-year-old shared an Instagram post for Real Housewives of Miami star Larsa Pippen's 50th birthday that featured a photo of the duo in bathing suits badly Photoshopped into a beach scene. Fans quickly responded, commenting on the messy editing and making their own memes. \"Did you deliberately make it look like a Photoshop?\" Ripa, 53, asked Giudice during the segment.\"Well, it was her birthday. I was scrambling,\" the reality star replied. \"I was like, \u2018Oh my God, it\u2019s her birthday, I have a post a picture for her.\u2019 We\u2019re really close.\" She continued, \"That was the only picture I came across.

Hilaria, 40, was seen arriving alongside Alec, 66, as the actor and his lawyer Alec Spiro entered the First Judicial District Court in Santa Fe, New Mexico, on Tuesday, July 9, for jury selection in his criminal trial. The podcaster and soon-to-be reality television star was seen arriving at the courthouse with two of the couple's seven children. Alec previously appeared in court with his lawyer Spiro on Monday, July 8, for a day of hearings on legal motions related to the involuntary manslaughter trial. The actor's case is related to the 2021 fatal shooting of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins on the Western movie Rust. Alec was holding a prop gun when it discharged, additionally injuring director Joel Souza in the high-profile incident. The 30 Rock star has continually insisted he did not pull the weapon's trigger or know that the gun mistakenly contained live ammunition since the October 2021 incident. He submitted a not guilty plea in January shortly after a grand jury indicted him on the involuntary manslaughter charge and faces up to 18 months in prison if convicted. Alec and Hilaria share seven children, including Carmen, 10, Rafael, 8, Leonardo, 7, Romeo, 5, Eduardo, 3, Mar\u00eda, 3, and Ilaria, 19 months.

Ups and downs. 7 kids. (Plus Ireland, Andre and Holland.) Four dogs. Four cats. In spite of some tough times for me, I wouldn\u2019t trade any of it,\" he added, referencing his eldest child Ireland, her partner and his granddaughter, Holland. Ireland's mother is Alec's ex-wife Kim Basinger. \"Not only have there been joyful ups and sad downs that life inevitably brings, but we have also experienced everything from sideways, zigzags, tremendous love and also things that are so painfully and plainly backwards,\" Hilaria shared in her own anniversary tribute, alongside a photo of her leaning on Alec's shoulder. \"We hang on tight\u2026hold on to family and friends to source our comfort and energy.

        "text": "For three A Quiet Place film installments, the deadly monsters with heightened hearing have forced every human within the entire globe to not make a peep, or they\u2019ll be ripped to pieces. Within the post-apocalyptic horror-thriller world that director John Krasinski co-built (and died in as in-universe character Lee Abbott), it\u2019s clear what those four-legged Demogorgon-like (from Stranger Things) creatures hate: sound. But there are so many other mysteries surrounding them. Where did they come from? What are their true weaknesses? What the heck are their names? Here\u2019s everything you need to know about the Quiet Place monsters. What are the Quiet Place creatures\u2019 names? While never explicitly called by anything within the films, the online fandom has dubbed the creatures \u201cDeath Angels.\u201d The name comes from the first movie. In the scene where Lee is writing general questions to himself on the whiteboard, including the infamously memed, \u201cWHAT IS THE WEAKNESS,\u201d above the whiteboard is a newspaper clipping with an article's headline reading, \u201cDeath Angels.\u201d Though it sounds like the name of a biker gang, leave it to one witty, in-universe journalist to coin the term. However, according to A Quiet Place: Day One\u2019s writer/director Michael Sarnoski, the crew doesn\u2019t call the creatures \u201cDeath Angels\u201d behind the scenes. Since the first installment, VFX company Industrial Light & Magic (ILM) have referred to them as \u201cHappy\u201d and they either call them that or \u201cthe creature\u201d during effects work. Oh, the sweet irony in calling the deadliest creature the cheeriest of names. Where did the Death Angels come from? As established in the first installment and the latest released prequel, the Death Angels/Happy \u2014 we\u2019re going to use the former for consistency purposes \u2014 came from space. Oh yeah, the Death Angels are alien invaders! According to Krasinski in an Empire podcast interview from 2018, when he was developing their origins, he mythologized that they were from a planet with no humans and no light. They were an \u201cevolutionarily perfect machine.\u201d When their planet was destroyed, they hitched a ride on asteroids and dropped straight onto Earth. And in their rude, noisy arrival, it was game over for the human race. What are the Death Angels' abilities? The Death Angels are the most sensitive sensory creatures in film history. They bear the power to listen intimately to anything, whether in proximity or from many miles away. While it\u2019s never explained how far their abilities allow them to hear \u2014 mainly because nobody in the entries has been that bold (or stupid enough) to test the theory and live \u2014 it\u2019s known that any high frequency sounds or a crinkle of glass is enough to trigger them. Besides their hypersensitive hearing abilities, the Death Angels have armor-plated flesh, making them impenetrable to mere bullets. They\u2019re so powerful, even the U.S. military waved their white flag as the first installment features another background newspaper article clipping stating, \u201cWe can no longer protect you.\u201d What are the Dark Angels\u2019 weaknesses? The Death Angels already go after every minuscule sound known to man, but if anything is at a raging high frequency as say, a continuous loud ringing sound prompted by a microphone and hearing aid on collision (like Coca-Cola and Mentos), it causes the Death Angel to dizzy out of control. In response to their torment, their armored heads open up wide as you see their fleshy, smiley-shaped face. It's the only time they are vulnerable to weapons. As seen by the epic first film\u2019s conclusion, when Regan Abbott (Millicent Simmonds) puts her hearing aid against a microphone, emitting a high frequency sound against the raging Death Angel in her home, the creature spirals out. Her mom, Evelyn Abbott (Emily Blunt), then shoots it in the face with a shotgun, killing it instantly. Cut to black! Such a strong ending. Another weakness of the Death Angels is similar to a cat: water. They can't swim, and the sound of running water can mask noises like humans talking. Set pieces within A Quiet Place Part II and Day One exemplify this as characters evade Dark Angels by jumping into the ocean and swimming to a nearby surface for safety. In one instance, during Part II, Regan and Emmett (Noah Jupe) jump into the water and a Death Angel instantly drowns in an attempt to catch them. How can someone avoid a Death Angel attack? Make no sound whatsoever. Be mindful of your surroundings and oxygen choices. Try to talk in the most hushed tones \u2014 or better yet, learn sign language. Much of the first two installments of A Quiet Place\u2019s dialogue are spoken through American Sign Language (ASL). When can someone talk freely without getting killed by a Death Angel? The only occasion when someone can talk at whatever volume they like is during a loud thunderstorm. The sheer noise of water droplets across an encompassing location confuses the Death Angels. In A Quiet Place: Day One, star-crossed survivors Sam (Lupita Nyong'o) and Eric (Joseph Quinn) are given the solace to scream in pain and anguish during a thunderstorm. Loud, natural terrains like waterfalls also grant the people the freedom to speak out loud. During the first flick, Lee takes his son Emmett to a waterfall for a little father-son bonding moment where they yell with glee. Smaller locations with running water, like fountains, are also applicable. In Day One, Sam goes to a loud fountain at a park to feed her cat Frodo a can of food. Once she loudly pops his can open, she\u2019s at the mercy of the fountain overflowing with noise. Want more movie news?

        "text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 A Russian internet propaganda campaign backed by the Kremlin that spread disinformation in the United States and relied on artificial intelligence has been disrupted, the Justice Department said Tuesday in announcing the seizure of nearly 1,000 bogus social media accounts. Officials described the operation as part of an ongoing effort to sow discord in the U.S. through the creation of fictitious social media profiles that purported to belong to legitimate users but were actually designed to advance the aims of the Russian government, including by spreading disinformation about its war with Ukraine. U.S. officials said the scheme was organized in 2022 by a senior editor at RT, a Russian-state funded media organization that has registered with the Justice Department as a foreign agent. It received the support and financial approval of the Kremlin, with an officer of Russia\u2019s Federal Security Service \u2014 or FSB \u2014 leading a private intelligence organization that promoted disinformation through social media. An email to RT was not immediately returned Tuesday. The disruption of the so-called social media bot farm comes as U.S. officials have raised alarms about the potential for AI technology to impact American elections and amid ongoing concerns that foreign influence campaigns by adversaries could shape the opinions of unsuspecting voters, like an elaborate plot by Russians to disrupt the 2016 presidential election through a huge but hidden social media trolling campaign aimed in part at helping Republican Donald Trump defeat Democrat Hillary Clinton. \u201cToday\u2019s actions represent a first in disrupting a Russian-sponsored Generative AI-enhanced social media bot farm,\u201d FBI Director Christopher Wray said in a statement. \u201cRussia intended to use this bot farm to disseminate AI-generated foreign disinformation, scaling their work with the assistance of AI to undermine our partners in Ukraine and influence geopolitical narratives favorable to the Russian government.\u201d Among the fake posts, according to the Justice Department, was a video that was posted by a purported Minneapolis, Minnesota resident that showed Russian President Vladimir Putin saying that areas of Ukraine, Poland and Lithuania were \u201cgifts\u201d to those countries from liberating Russian forces during World War II. As part of the disruption, the Justice Department seized two domain names and 968 accounts on X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter. The FBI and the Cyber National Mission Force also worked with with the Canadian Centre for Cyber Security and law enforcement in the Netherlands on a joint cybersecurity advisory about the social media bot farm.",

        "text": "A woman is going viral on TikTok after sharing the lifelike dolls she makes herself \u2014 shipping them worldwide so others can \"adopt\" the babies. Maria Trigg, 36, tells PEOPLE in an exclusive interview that she's been a doll collector nearly her whole life, and began making various dolls as a child growing up in Colombia. \"At a very young age, my mom taught me how to sculpt in clay,\" Trigg, who goes by Coly or \"Mama Coly\" on social media, tells PEOPLE. \"I fell in love with the possibility of making my own dolls pretty early on.\" She adds, \"As a kid, I used to make so many kinds of dolls \u2014 paper dolls, fabric dolls, clay dolls \u2014 but once I found out silicone could feel so much like a real baby, it was over. I knew that\u2019s what I wanted to do.\" Never miss a story \u2014 sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories. In 2010, Trigg says she discovered reborns, handmade dolls that have been created to resemble a realistic human infant. \"I was immediately obsessed,\" Trigg says. \"Looking back at myself as a little girl in Colombia, I dreamed of having a realistic doll and remember how impossible it seemed to ever have one made for me.\" She learned how to sculpt and paint silicone dolls in 2013, from watching YouTube videos, and began selling the dolls she created by hand in 2020, when they went viral during the pandemic. Trigg explains that there are two processes to reborn dolls: to paint silicone molds that already exist and add more intricate details, like lifelike skin and hair, or to create them from scratch. \"[To create original dolls,] I start literally with a lump of clay and a picture of a baby for inspiration. I try my best to do with my hands what I am seeing with my eyes,\" she says. When the sculpture is finished, Trigg then creates a mold out of silicone and fills the mold with a different, softer type of silicone to cast a replica of the sculpture. \"Once the silicone sculpted baby is 'born,' we then paint the dolls with silicone paint; this process is done with a mottling sponge and many intricate layers to create the lifelike skin effect. Finally, we add our baby soft finish. This is done by finishing the doll with the silicone paint and adding silica powder to it,\" she says. Once the doll is finished, she even gives it a bath in order to find areas that are in need of repair. \"Once the doll is fully ready, we then micro-root hair and lashes, which means we insert mohair one by one to make it as realistic as possible. We finalize the doll by glossing the lips and any other area upon request,\" she says. Reborns are most often collected by adults, in a process often referred to as \"adoption.\" In some of her videos, Trigg can be seen getting the newly-purchased babies ready for their adoptions, measuring and weighing them before putting them in a diaper and a new outfit. The price range for the dolls varies widely. A pre-manufactured reborn doll starts at around $50, Trigg says, while a hand-sculpted original finished silicone doll can cost upwards of $5,000 or even $10,000, depending on the artist. \"Personally, my silicone dolls start at $45 for my miniatures and can go up to $1,500 for the larger dolls,\" she adds. And while they are dolls, they aren't toys and are geared toward adult collectors \u2014 in part, because they are \"extremely delicate,\" Trigg says.As for why they've become so popular and resonate with her social media audience, Trigg chalks it up to her passion, \"A lot of people are very private about their doll collections so me being so loud and proud about it is something that I think has inspired a lot of people to truly do what makes them happy,\" she says. \"I get a lot of people telling me that I have inspired them to not be ashamed of their hobby.\" Trigg also acknowledges that many of her followers and collectors have turned to the dolls as somewhat of a coping mechanism. \"[Some] have told me the dolls have helped them during a healing journey \u2014 whether they are going through the grief of having lost a child or anxiety/depression/dementia.\" Still, there is occasional pushback from those who don't understand the dolls, or write negatively about them in the comments on Trigg's videos. \"There are a lot of people that are afraid of dolls or completely repelled by them, immediately deeming anyone who collects dolls to be mentally unstable,\" she says. She continues: \"I'm here to show the world that we are allowed to collect dolls just like other people collect anything else; some people have closets full of shoes they will never wear or are too afraid to wear because they might get dirty. Some people collect stamps, and while I don\u2019t understand that, I don\u2019t judge it ... What makes dolls any different? To me, that nurturing spirit is a gift, and I am not ashamed of it.\"",

From \u201cDead Poets Society\u201d to \u201cMork & Mindy,\u201d Williams was unforgettable. On stage he was an unstoppable one-man hilarity machine. So it goes without saying that his performance made \u201cMrs. Doubtfire\u201d a kitsch classic. The Broadway musical version of that beloved \u201890s flick, while a ton of fun, is nowhere near as memorable. It\u2019s like a recipe you remember loving when your grandmother made it but you can\u2019t really remember all of the ingredients. There\u2019s still a middle-aged San Francisco dad in a dress pretending to be a no-nonsense Scottish nanny to woo back his ex-wife but there\u2019s only some of the oodles of charm that Williams brought to the party. The good news is that this new iteration of \u201cMrs. Doubtfire,\u201d directed by the estimable Jerry Zaks, still tickles the funny bones of all ages. Unlike other musicals recycled from movies, from \u201cBeetlejuice\u201d to \u201cMean Girls,\u201d \u201cDoubtfire\u201d doesn\u2019t try too hard or dumb things down. This \u201cDoubtfire\u201d makes peace with its essentially escapist nature. Rob McClure may not be Williams in the title but he sure is lovably kooky. His celebrity impersonations instantly won over the kiddos in the audience, particularly his spot-on Gollum and Darth Vader. The original movie was a light-hearted punchline machine and the musical maintains that yuk-it-up aesthetic, poking fun at everything from San Francisco real estate to the pop-up ads that plague YouTube tutorials. Lorin Latarro\u2019s spunky choreography for the kitchen extravaganza, a symphony of pots and pans, in \u201cEasy Peasy\u201d is delightful even if the number goes on too long. Sometimes the show also drags when it tries to get too serious. The production never establishes the emotional connection between Daniel and Maggie (Maggie Lakis) so their divorce proceedings lack a sense of reality. That undercuts both Miranda\u2019s inner journey to being single again and Daniel\u2019s outward romp around town in skirts and heels. The stakes just aren\u2019t high enough. Likewise, Miranda\u2019s competing love interest, the muscle-bound gym tycoon Stuart (Leo Roberts) is so under-developed as a character, you really do miss the effortless debonair manner of Bond-era Pierce Brosnan. However these quibbles aside, this musical comedy is still a hoot and a half. The chorus of vacuum-wielding Doubtfires, drubbing Daniel on the head with their purses, steals the show in the \u201cPlaying With Fire\u201d number. \u201cMrs. Doubtfire\u201d is the Mary Poppins of feel-good family fluff for a new generation.

The former soccer player, 38, posted a heartfelt birthday message for Bush in which she declared her love for the actress as she turned 42 on Monday, July 8. \u201cHappy birthday beautiful. I hope today feels special and full knowing how much we love you,\u201d Harris wrote alongside a carousel of photos she posted of her and Bush on Instagram. \u201cYou are such a gift in this world. To see you shine and happy fills us all up. I love your heart Soph \u2026 I love everything about you,\u201d she continued. \u201cHappy born day baby.\u201d In response to the loving post, Bush said of Harris in the comments section that she found \u201cthe very best love in an unexpected place.\u201d \u201cLast year I got free. This year I found the very best love in the very most unexpected place. I may never get over the gift of it,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThank you for putting me back together.

You are my best present \u2728.\" Among the photos shared in Harris\u2019 birthday tribute was a shot of her lying with her arm around Bush from a glamorous photoshoot, a joint selfie of the pair holding up cocktail glasses, and them sweetly embracing at a restaurant. The couple were also snapped sharing a kiss in a couple of photos as Harris stroked Bush\u2019s cheek. The pair stuck their tongues together in a final cheeky shot. Harris shared more photos of her and Bush celebrating the actress' birthday on her Instagram Stories, as the couple appeared to head out to a restaurant. In one snap, the pair blew out a candle together that was placed on a dessert dish for Bush with \u2018Happy Birthday\u2019 written on it in chocolate icing. In a clip shared, which appeared to have been filmed the same day, Harris and Bush looked happy in love as they also went out for a stroll arm-in-arm together. Harris and Bush made their last public appearance together at the celebration of Woolf Works at New York City's American Ballet Theatre on June 25.

Midway through the songs, he then launched into a rap over the ska-reggae number: \"This is a dance done from north to south / This is a dance done from north to south / East, West, / Panama, and Jamaica, uh / Every but- wan move your feet, ah / Love my girly, love my dog / And love my God, I feel gon' stand-stand for / I'm unreal / When I'm on the microphone it get real.\" In late May, Sublime released \"Feel Like That,\" which also features vocals from Scott Woodruff of Stick Figure, as well as the band's founding members Eric Wilson and Bud Gaugh. Not only was the single the band's first release since their viral Coachella set with Jakob at the helm, but it also was released just one day prior to the 28th anniversary of Bradley's death. \u201cThis song came about in an organic way. My uncles and I always want to collab with artists in different modern music scenes,\" the Jakobs Castle artist said in a press release. \"But hearing my own voice on a track side by side with my dad's voice really feels like the classic Sublime sound stepping into the modern era.\" Jakob added: \"SoCal music is my family\u2019s pride and joy and our family is getting bigger every day.

While many reactions disparaged him with homophobic comments, the FaZe family of streamers had his back and were there to support him. Who is Sketch? Sketch, whose real name is Kylie Cox, is a Twitch streamer who gained popularity on TikTok for streaming Madden, and has become known for his catchphrase, \u201cWhat\u2019s up, Brother?\u201d The affable guy is relatively new on the scene and has only been streaming with the \u201cFaZe Clan,\u201d a group of popular esports streamers, for less than a year. What are the allegations against Sketch? Rumors of Sketch\u2019s time as an OnlyFans model started with an anonymously posted YouTube video on July 7, 2024, to the YouTube account Pocketbook. In the video, the poster revealed that Sketch used names such as Jamie Mar HTXXX, Jamie Mara TX, Jamie Mar NSFW, and Jamies Couture with his adult content, which is mostly LGBTQ+-oriented. The anonymous poster included screenshots of images taken from \u201cJamie\u2019s\u201d various accounts and tweets on X (previously known as Twitter) with poorly-cropped edits to make the images safe to be viewed on YouTube. Pocketbook compared Sketch\u2019s facial features to that of the OnlyFans model and even dug into older photos of the streamer to solidify their claim. The video went viral practically overnight, with the vast majority of commenters lambasting the account owner for outing Sketch. Is Sketch an OnlyFans model? The simple answer, confirmed by Sketch himself on Twitch: yes, he was. \u201cWasn\u2019t planning on doing this today, but I guess so, okay? I\u2019ll start from the top,\u201d he said on his Twitch stream on July 8th, 2024. \u201cLook at this, open and honest: That was me. That was me. It\u2019s okay, though.\u201d He told his viewers that two years ago, he had been going through a \u201cdark time. A rough time.\u201d He also said that he was fighting with \u201caddiction problems\u201d when he he was posting adult content. \u201cBut on a real note, I\u2019ve been living under the threat of that coming out for two years,\u201d he told viewers. \u201cStarted social media, just kind of d-cking around, had that in my past. I\u2019ll tell you what. Weight lifted off my shoulders. God is good. All the time.\u201d In his stream, Sketch said that if the OnlyFans content were ever leaked, he was going to either quit social media altogether\u2014or worse. \u201cI\u2019ll say it candidly; Plan A was to call it quits if this ever came out, but some people saved me. Shout out Banks. Shout out my parents. Shout out y\u2019all. I f-cked up, but I\u2019m changed.\u201d \u201cMy original plan was, there\u2019s two things. One, either be delusional and think it\u2019s never gonna come out, or two\u2026 what\u2019s the plan after? The plan after was not very good. If I was alone and I was at my house, I probably wouldn\u2019t be talking to you right now.\u201d The streamer said that it was because of his parents, FaZe, and \u201cBanks especially\u201d that he\u2019s been able to come through the situation and is still here. In his typical jokey manner, Sketch said he wasn\u2019t sure if he would be continuing to stream, but asked, \u201cWhat did Kim Kardashian do?\u201d Reactions to the Jamie Marr/Sketch leaks Banks is a FaZe cofounder, and he tweeted his support of Sketch amid the leaks on July 8 not long before the streamer went live on Twitch. In the post on X, Banks said, \u201cNot everything needs to be broadcast & farmed, but since yall wana jump to crazy assumptions Sketch told me to post these receipts. All the FaZe boys were with him last night. Sketch was my homie yesterday, he\u2019s my homie today, he\u2019ll be my homie tomorrow. You guys are fkn weirdos.\u201d He included images in the tweet of a text conversation with Sketch telling him to come back and that he would support him, as well as a Nest camera photo of Sketch heading to the airport, and the shoes and glasses he left behind in his rush to leave after the OnlyFans leaks went viral on social media. Other streamers have stepped up to support Sketch, including Kai Cenat, who said, \u201cWhy does something somebody else do get you so mad to the point you gotta bully them, The Internet is a crazy place.\u201d In a Reddit post about the Sketch leaks, people were, once again, extremely supportive of the streamer, saying they hoped he would be able to come out of this all right and questioning why it was even a \u201cgotcha\u201d moment topic to begin with. Sketch did not immediately respond to the Daily Dot\u2019s request for comment via Instagram direct message.

        "text": "Former \u201cThe Daily Show\u201d host Trever Noah\u2019s professed love of Microsoft could be a conflict of interest, The Post has learned. The comedian has gushed over Microsoft products like the company\u2019s tablet-laptop combo, the Surface Pro X, calling it \u201cessential\u201d in a 2019 interview with GQ. However, he hasn\u2019t always disclosed the fact he has been working for the company since 2016. The Federal Trade Commission, which declined to comment, has recently ramped up actions against influencers and celebrities who fail to disclose a monetary relationship with products they endorse. \u201cSuch connection [business, family, or personal relationship] must be disclosed clearly and conspicuously,\u201d an FTC rule reads. \u201cIf you do an endorsement in a way that isn\u2019t immediately obvious it\u2019s paid \u2026 that violates the spirit and letter of the law,\u201d Adam Candeub, a law professor at Michigan State University and senior fellow at the DC-based Center of Renewing America, told The Post. On top of that, Noah, 40, has hosted glowing interviews with Microsoft executive including CEO Satya Nadella (2017) and president Brad Smith (2019) on \u201cThe Daily Show,\u201d which he left in 2022. That same year, he also interviewed Smith on his Spotify podcast, \u201cWhat Now?\u201d Noah most recently interviewed Smith on his podcast last month, gushingly calling him \u201cnot just the Vice Chair and President of Microsoft, but a thinker. I really appreciate you as a deep thinker.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s the way big tech exerts influence \u2026 they have a fancy way of buying endorsements,\u201d Candeub added. Noah landed the first big interview with Open AI CEO Sam Altman in December 2023, after Altman was briefly ousted then reinstated days later by ChatGPT\u2019s parent company \u2014 which Microsoft has a 49% stake in. The comedian told Altman on his podcast: \u201cI think calling you the Steve Jobs of this generation is unfair. In my opinion, I think you\u2019re the Prometheus of this generation,\u201d referring to the Greek god credited with giving humanity civilization. Noah \u2014 who did not respond to The Post\u2019s requests for comment \u2014 also conducted glowing interviews on \u201cThe Daily Show\u201d with Smith in 2019 and Nadella in 2017, as well as including multiple Microsoft products he \u201ccan\u2019t live without\u201d in the 2019 GQ article. It is unclear if GQ knew Noah was on the tech giant\u2019s payroll at the time and the magazine did not respond to requests for comment. Microsoft hired Noah after he hosted a damning segment ridiculing a the company\u2019s Tay chatbot. Within hours of its 2016 launch, the chatbot posted sexually explicit, racist and antisemitic tweets including \u201cHitler was right I hate jews\u201d and \u201cF\u2013K MY ROBOT P\u2014Y DADDY I\u2019M SUCH A BAD NAUGHTY ROBOT.\u201d The bot also embraced conspiracy theories, posting \u201cBush did 9/11.\u201d The bot was quickly shut down and Microsoft issued an apology, but Tay was widely mocked. Highlighting the debacle in a \u201cDaily Show\u201d segment, Noah called it the \u201cmost offensive\u201d product the company had ever unleashed. He was then recruited by Microsoft to help with unspecified \u201cconsulting.\u201d He started working with its product development team, according to The Hollywood Reporter, and \u201chas applied for multiple patents\u201d related to \u201cmultiscreen computing devices.\u201d It is unclear what his role entailed, but in 2022 he was given the title of \u201cChief Questions Officer,\u201d according to a press release. \u201cAs Microsoft Chief Questions Officer, Trevor uses humor, insight, and curiosity to engage with the future of AI for powering change,\u201d the company said in a statement. A Microsoft spokesperson told The Post that \u201cour work with Trevor specifically excludes product promotion.\u201d Representatives for GQ did not respond to requests for comment. As part of his role, Noah announced he would host a Microsoft YouTube series, \u201cThe Prompt,\u201d which \u201cexplores how technology like AI, cloud computing, gaming and edtech are driving social impact.\u201d He has hosted six episodes since its launch, with titles like \u201cAI is sometimes the only solution\u201d and \u201cHow is AI protecting vulnerable communities?\u201d One insider familiar with Microsoft\u2019s communications strategy called it a \u201csmart move\u201d to bring on a familiar TV face like Noah. \u201cHe is a trusted source by a lot of people,\u201d the source told The Post.",

Of course, he would like to see us have many other conflicts around the world and inside of the countries,\u201d he said on Tuesday during an event with Politico Live and WELT. The minister went on to take a dig at Canada, which is one of a handful of countries that failed to meet the alliance\u2019s major spending requirements. Canada and Belgium are the only alliance members that failed to reach 2% of their gross domestic product on defense spending and failed to spend at least 20% of their spending on equipment, weapons, and other capabilities. \u201cWe would like to see that still the focus will be Ukraine, but we also understand the Indo-Pacific situation and also, at the end of the day, well not at the end of the day, but then someone comes and says well actually the biggest problem is climate change,\u201d Pevkur said. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is expected to speak on Tuesday on the sidelines of the summit to discuss the international security implications of climate change.

The teen \u2014 who has been identified as Mainor Perez, according to NBC affiliate WRAL and the Goldsboro Daily News \u2014 and his brother Yunior were fishing in the New River Inlet on Thursday, July 4, around 11 a.m. local time when Mainor was swept away, WRAL reported. After he vanished, the North Topsail Beach Fire Rescue and Coast Guard worked to find Perez and deployed a drone to help search and recovery efforts, per the reports. Perez's body had washed ashore on base at Camp Lejeune on Sunday, July 7, according to WRAL. The North Topsail Police Department contacted Mainor's family to let them know they had found a body. PEOPLE has reached out to the North Topsail Beach Police Department for comment. Yunior told WRAL that Mainor went into the inlet with another brother when the water swept the teen away. \"The water wasn\u2019t too deep, but someone explained to me later there are holes like 30 feet deep, and I think that\u2019s what happened, [Mainor] slipped in and he couldn\u2019t get out,\" he told the Goldsboro Daily News. \"The current was going in and not going out.\" A nearby boat was able to save the brother, but Mainor went underwater, per WRAL. \"He couldn't do anything because I saw him in the boat, and he tried to swim back by himself,\" Yunior told the outlet, which noted that the New River Inlet is known for its strong currents and has signage marking the dangers of the water.

He floated up on the third day.\u201d Yunior told the Goldsboro Daily News about what his brother planned for the future. \"I started a construction company about six months ago, and he was helping me with that,\" he added. \"He was already planning on attending Wayne Community College and then transferring to UNC Chapel Hill.\u201d \"We're going to miss him so much. I'm not sure how we're going to go through this,\" Yunior told the station. \"It's hard.\" As of July 9, over $7,000 has been raised via GoFundMe on behalf of the teen's family.",

As Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes and his wife Brittany's European vacation (which included seeing Swift, 34, in concert!) comes to an end, the 28-year-old mother of two showed her love for the singer on social media. In an Instagram Story, Brittany filmed the streets of London, England as she sat in the backseat of a car. The Kansas City Current owner set the story to Swift's song \"So Long, London\" from her most recent album, The Tortured Poets Department. \"So Long, London,\" Brittany wrote over the video, adding a white heart emoji as she and Patrick, 28, prepare for their next destination. On Saturday, July 6, Patrick and Brittany joined his teammate and Swift's boyfriend, Travis Kelce, in a private suite at the second night of the Grammy winner\u2019s Eras Tour stop in Amsterdam.

        "text": "HOUSTON \u2014 Many of the millions left without power after Hurricane Beryl crashed into Texas, killing several people and unleashing flooding, sweltered and fretted Tuesday as the storm deprived them of air conditioning, food and water in dangerous heat. A heat advisory took effect through Wednesday in the Houston area and beyond, with temperatures expected to soar into the 90s and humidity that could make it feel as hot as 105 degrees. \u201cWe can handle it, but not the kids,\u201d said Walter Perez, 49, as he arrived early Tuesday at celebrity pastor Joel Osteen\u2019s megachurch in Houston, which served as a cooling center and distributed 40-bottle packs of water to cars that drove up. Perez said he, his wife, their 3-year-old son and 3-week-old daughter, and his father-in-law retreated from their apartment after a night he described as \u201cbad, bad, bad, bad.\u201d Beryl, which made landfall early Monday as a Category 1 hurricane, has been blamed for at least seven U.S. deaths \u2014 one in Louisiana and six in Texas, officials said. At midday Tuesday, it was a post-tropical cyclone centered over Arkansas and was forecast to bring heavy rains and possible flooding to a swath extending to the Great Lakes and Canada. More than 2.2 million homes and businesses around Houston lacked electricity Tuesday, down from a peak of over 2.7 million on Monday, according to PowerOutage.us. For many, it was a miserable repeat after storms in May killed eight people and left nearly 1 million without power amid flooded streets. Food spoiled in listless refrigerators in neighborhoods that pined for air conditioning. Long lines of cars and people queued up at any fast food restaurant, food truck or gas station that had power and was open. Damonte Oliver, 32, visited Osteen\u2019s Lakewood Church with his girlfriend and her mother. Their apartment had lost power for days after the May storm. \u201cI know they are trying to do their best to get everything back on. It\u2019s just a waiting game on how long it\u2019s going to take,\u201d he said before walking to a convenience store to buy cigarettes. \u201cI\u2019ve got to calm down a little bit myself,\u201d Oliver said. It could take days to fully return power in Texas after Beryl toppled 10 transmission lines. Top priorities for power restoration include nursing homes and assisted living centers, said Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, who is acting as governor while Gov. Greg Abbott is out of the country. Sixteen hospitals were running on generator power Tuesday morning, according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Beryl\u2019s strength at midday Tuesday \u2014 with sustained winds near 30 mph \u2014 wasn\u2019t expected to change much in the next two days. It was forecast to bring heavy rains and possible flash flooding from the lower and mid-Mississippi Valley to the Great Lakes into Wednesday, the National Weather Service said. A flood watch was in effect for parts of Oklahoma, Arkansas, Missouri, Illinois, Indiana and Michigan. A few tornadoes were possible in Missouri, Tennessee, Kentucky, Illinois, Indiana and Ohio, forecasters said. When Beryl made landfall, it was far less powerful than the Category 5 behemoth that tore a deadly path through parts of Mexico and the Caribbean. But its winds and rains still knocked down hundreds of trees that had already been teetering in saturated earth and stranded dozens of cars on flooded roads. Beryl, the earliest storm to develop into a Category 5 hurricane in the Atlantic, caused at least 11 deaths as it passed through the Caribbean on its way to Texas. In Jamaica, officials said Monday that island residents will have to contend with food shortages after Beryl destroyed over $6.4 million in crops and supporting infrastructure.

The pretty, piped design costs upwards of $100 \u2014 but if you\u2019re hoping spend a little less on luxe-looking sleepwear, Nordstrom\u2019s Moonlight PJs are nearly identical. What\u2019s more, thanks to the Nordstrom Anniversary Sale (which began on July 9 for select cardholders and opens to everyone on July 15), a handful of styles are currently marked down to under $50. The Moonlight Eco Knit Pajamas ($79 $50) are a dead ringer for the Eberjey set we\u2019ve spotted on everyone from Kris Jenner to Meghan Markle, the latter of whom wore the style on an episode of \u201cSuits.\u201d Nordstrom Moonlight Eco Knit Pajamas Nordstrom Moonlight Short Pajamas Not only does the classic pick come in plus sizes ($79 $50), there are also multiple variations available \u2014including the more summer-friendly Moonlight Short Pajamas ($65 $44).

Attorney Mike Davis, the founder of an organization advocating for conservative judicial nominees, said in an interview on Benny Johnson\u2019s YouTube channel that if Trump is elected to a second term, there will be \u201csevere\u201d consequences for those involved in the criminal charges against the former president, including Justice Department special counsel Jack Smith. \"Look, I would say to Jack Smith that right now you guys are the hunters and on January 20th you're going to become the hunted,\" Davis said. \"We need to give them retribution. And people are like, 'You can't do retribution.' Yes, retribution is a big part of justice.\" In a separate clip shared by Johnson, Davis claimed without evidence that the indictments against Trump are part of \"a criminal conspiracy by these Democrat prosecutors, these Democrat judges, these Democrat witnesses, these Democrat operatives.\" \"And guess what guys? There are going to be severe legal, political and financial consequences. We are not going to turn the other cheek, they can go to hell,\" he added. Davis, who is a former high-ranking staffer for Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley and Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch, previously told Johnson about his plans if he were to be appointed attorney general by Trump. \"During my three week reign of terror as Trump acting attorney general before I get chased out of town with my Trump pardon, I will rain hell on Washington, D.C,\" Davis said on The Benny Show in September. \"I have five lists ready to go and they're growing.\" Never miss a story \u2014 sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer\u200b\u200b, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.

During her opening monologue, the comedic actress poked fun at the news that Democrats are trying to find a way for President Joe Biden to \u201cmove forward\u201d amid growing concerns regarding his age. But Hahn was quick to point out that Donald Trump, who is 78 years old, is not so far off from Biden\u2019s age of 81. \u201cDemocrats in congress are reportedly trying to find the best way for Biden to move forward, which is probably with one of those walkers with the tennis balls on the bottom of it,\u201d she joked. She added, \u201cThe truth is, both candidates are very old. This might be the first presidential race where a slick bathtub could alter the course of history.\u201d For Hahn, however, any candidate is better than having Trump in the oval office again. \u201cI would vote for a skeleton over Donald Trump,\u201d she confessed, before dejectedly adding, \u201cIn fact, I may literally be voting for a skeleton over Donald Trump.\u201d The actress also highlighted her upcoming WandaVision spinoff series that is set to premiere on Disney+ this fall, Agatha All Along. Per the show\u2019s official logline, \u201cThe infamous Agatha Harkness finds herself down and out of power after a suspicious goth teen helps break her free from a distorted spell. Her interest is piqued when he begs her to take him on the legendary Witches\u2019 Road, a magical gauntlet of trials that, if survived, rewards a witch with what they\u2019re missing. Together, Agatha and this mysterious teen pull together a desperate coven, and set off down, down, down The Road.\u201d Hahn is the latest celebrity to guest host Jimmy Kimmel Live amid Kimmel\u2019s summer vacation. In June, Martin Short kicked off the star-studded summer with a week interviewing his Only Murders in the Building co-stars, as well as a bizarre \u201cmusical salute\u201d to Trump. ABC announced that Ryan Reynolds, Hugh Jackman, Kathryn Hahn, Jeff Goldblum, RuPaul, Lamorne Morris, and Anthony Anderson are also set to guest host Jimmy Kimmel Live this summer. The set dates will be announced at a later time. Kimmel will reportedly return to the show Labor Day (Sept. 2). Jimmy Kimmel Live airs weeknights on ABC at 11:35/10:35c.",

        "text": "Russia has successfully rebuilt its \"war-stage\" economy much faster than expected, and it is now cranking out far more artillery ammunition than it was prior to the beginning of the Ukraine war, a NATO defense chief said Tuesday.Before Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Moscow was producing up to 400,000 152mm rounds per year. These can be fired from Soviet-era towed howitzer cannons. But that figure has since swelled to 2 million rounds annually, according to Laurynas Kas\u010di\u016bnas, Lithuania's minister of national defense.\"They are moving quite fast,\" Kas\u010di\u016bnas said during a roundtable discussion hosted by POLITICO and German television outlet Welt on the sidelines of the NATO summit in Washington, DC.Russian President Vladimir Putin has taken significant steps to move the country's economy onto what experts have described as a \"Soviet-style\" war footing. This past spring, for instance, he reshuffled Moscow's military leadership to boost defense-industrial base output and support the mass production of weaponry.Despite international efforts to inflict economic pain on Russia over its war, through actions like sanctions, Kas\u010di\u016bnas said Moscow's \"war-stage economy\" has recovered \"faster than we expected.\" Top US officials and generals have offered similar assessments about the country's military power.Increased artillery shell output is a key indicator. Moscow's output of 152mm shells dwarfs production estimates for the NATO-standard 155mm shells. In Europe, for instance, the annual production rate for this type of artillery munition is less than 600,000 rounds, and in the US, it is lower than 350,000.Kas\u010di\u016bnas said Putin has heavily invested a lot of the country's GDP \u2014 reportedly nearly 7% \u2014 into military spending but will need to keep the economy on this track because resorting back to what it was before the war would lead to a \"crisis.\"\"For that, he needs to have an enemy \u2014 to have challenges,\" Kas\u010di\u016bnas said. \"Now, it's Ukraine. Maybe after that, somebody else.\"Kas\u010di\u016bnas delivered his remarks alongside Estonian Defense Minister Hanno Pevkur and Latvian Defense Minister Andris Spr\u016bds. On NATO's front line, the three Baltic nations have been staunch supporters of Ukraine and persistent advocates on security assistance to Kyiv, fearing that Russia may target them in the future.Having also been the target of hybrid attacks by neighboring Russia, the Baltic countries have long pushed for increased defense spending among NATO members and are vocal in ensuring that the military alliance has the necessary capabilities to deter and defend against a broader Russian assault against Europe.Kas\u010di\u016bnas said that in order to build a credible defensive regime that can effectively deter Russia, it's necessary to fill capability gaps like air defense and long-range munitions. The Baltics already have several initiatives underway to help address these shortcomings and are among NATO's top defense spenders as a share of GDP, but there's still more to be done, the officials noted on Tuesday.\"We are moving forward, but only little by little,\" Kas\u010di\u016bnas said.",

        "text": "Russia\u2019s bloody invasion of Ukraine continues to claim lives, as the Kremlin\u2019s military leadership resorts to increasingly brutal tactics against civilians\u2014including a ghastly attack on a children's hospital in Kyiv and other sites across Ukraine. In their comments on state television, prominent propagandists often reiterate that Moscow\u2019s campaign of senseless brutality is designed to prompt Ukrainians to overthrow their government. Russian talking heads also resort to nuclear threats, which is always a sign that things on the battlefront are not going well. Indeed, Russian propagandists and military experts are tacitly acknowledging sinking morale and widespread lying in their military. Despite sunny reports by Russia\u2019s Defense Ministry, grim realities prompted the newest Minister of Defense Andrey Belousov to stress, \u201cMaking mistakes is acceptable; lying is not.\u201d Appearing on Tuesday\u2019s broadcast of Vladimir Solovyov\u2019s morning show, Full Contact, military expert Vladislav Shurygin revealed some examples of the dishonesty Russian authorities are having to contend with. Using the code 500s, he said that there are soldiers who have fled or refused to fight in Ukraine. Shurygin recounted, \u201cI was talking to a Commander of one regiment, who said that their neighboring division did not support them, did not go into battle. Why? Because according to their list, there are 1,400 soldiers, but in reality, there are half as many. Tons of people are running around elsewhere, some did not come back from their vacations, but there is no desire to report it honestly, because there will be repercussions.\u201d He continued, \u201cWhen we\u2019re asking why we can\u2019t forcefully move forward, when you add up all of these issues\u2014turns out, we have systematic problems.\u201d Solovyov, who demonstrates his loyalty to Putin\u2019s regime by doggedly producing reports from the frontlines, relayed another glaring issue. He said Russian military commanders have been falsely claiming to have taken certain towns or villages. \u201cYou brought up lying,\u201d he said. \u201cMy close friend, Ilyukha\u2014I talk about him a lot\u2014the head of combat training for the fifth brigade, created a system of red underpants. They would regularly get hit because of their lying neighboring units. They exclaimed that certain places were taken, but then it turned out that they actually weren\u2019t.\u201d Solovyov described the process that had to be created because of these deceptive commanders: A surveillance drone is sent to the area that was supposedly taken by Russian troops, \u201cIf you\u2019re really there, wave a red rag over your head. Then it becomes clear whether you\u2019re really there, or are just claiming to be there in your reports. This is called a system of red underpants, it works very well. You immediately see what is real and what is a fairy tale.\u201d Shurygin complained that this problem is not limited to low-level commanders and is prevalent on the highest levels, adding, \u201cWe can recall how our Supreme Commander received reports that the village of Krynky was taken, and everything is tremendous. Then we spent six more months squeezing the enemy out of there.\u201d He was referring to a meeting of Russia\u2019s former Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu with Putin in February of 2024, when he falsely assured the Russian president that the village of Krynky was taken. Recounting his meetings with unnamed high-ranking officials, Solovyov claimed they are aware of the widespread lying and know that every bit of information must be re-checked and verified. Shurygin noted, \u201cIn reality, just like you, I have a feeling of anxious anticipation. I realize that summer is already in its second half and there hasn\u2019t been any significant breakthrough on the frontlines, for many different reasons.\u201d He bemoaned the division in Russian society, where one half is preoccupied with war, gathering funds for the frontlines\u2014and the rest prefer to forget about the invasion and live as though it isn\u2019t happening. Tense and morose, Solovyov laced the rest of his program with heavy sighs and loud complaints. He attempted to reassure his viewers with promises of a desperately needed military coalition that will step in to join the ranks of Russia\u2019s wavering troops. Imagining the likes of WHO? China and North Korea joining the fight, Solovyov said, \u201cNATO should understand they aren\u2019t going to fight against 150 million [Russians], but 1.5 to 2 billion people are behind us! Until then, they will keep jointly attacking us.\u201d",

        "text": "By Jonathan Landay and Tom Balmforth WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Russia lacks the munitions and troops to start a major offensive in Ukraine and would need to secure significant ammunition supplies from other countries beyond what it already has in order to do so, a senior NATO official said on Tuesday. Briefing reporters ahead of the opening of NATO's annual summit, the official also said that recent arson attacks, assassination plots and sabotage in Europe are part of a covert campaign by Russian President Vladimir Putin to undermine public support for Ukraine. On the battlefield, the official said Russia has been suffering \"very high\" losses as it struggles to exploit small territorial gains and lacks the troops and ammunition to mount a large-scale offensive. \"What they are having to do is order undermanned, inexperienced units to move into areas to achieve unrealistic objectives,\" said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. \"To sustain real offensive operations, we think that Russia would have to secure significant ammunition supplies from countries beyond what it is already getting from Iran and from North Korea,\" the official continued. \"And Vladimir Putin would have to order a new large-scale mobilization.\" Western and Ukrainian officials say Iran supplies suicide drones to Russia - a charge denied by Tehran - and North Korea has provided artillery shells and missiles to Moscow. Both deny that such transfers have taken place. \"We've seen Ukrainian defences improve significantly,\" the official said, adding that Kyiv also has sustained significant troop loses. He estimated that Russia would be able to maintain its war economy for three to four more years. Kyiv's forces have been on the back foot on the battlefield for months as Moscow's troops maintain heavy offensive pressure and advance slowly in the east of Ukraine. NATO begins a three-day summit in Washington on Tuesday that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy is attending more than 28 months since Russia launched its full-scale invasion. The official said \"it will be some time\" before Ukraine has amassed the munitions and personnel it needs to mount new large-scale offensive operations. \"We are seeing they're improving day by day,\" he added. COVERT CAMPAIGN NATO has responded to Russia's covert campaign to undermine European support for Ukraine by issuing two statements alerting Moscow that the alliance is aware of what it is doing, the official said. It has also significantly increased intelligence sharing among alliance members so \"we have a common picture of what's happening,\" the official said. \"The very first thing that you have to do when you're pushing back against something that Vladimir Putin believes is below the threshold... is to show him that we know what's happening,\" he said. He also singled out what he said was China's continuing provision of \"critical enabling pieces\" for drones, missiles and the Russian defence industry. The official said Putin \"still thinks time is on his side\" and is willing to endure \"truly staggering numbers of military casualties.\" Russia was recruiting about 30,000 troops per month, allowing it to sustain large battlefield losses, he said.

Peace 4 Animals, another animal welfare organization, added $5,100 to the reward, bringing the total to $7,600. According to In Defense of Animals, on July 3, two caring hikers found a distressed dog wandering around the rugged surroundings in the morning. The Good Samaritans quickly noticed the seemingly abandoned dog had his \"mouth was cruelly zip-tied shut, and another zip tie constricted his neck,\" per In Defense of Animals. Never miss a story \u2014 sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories. In response to this heartbreaking discovery, the hikers called 911 for help and removed the zip tie constricting the German shepherd's mouth before the authorities arrived. After police and animal control officers reached the hikers and dog, the group worked together to remove the zip tie around the dog's neck and carried the canine to safety. Officials transported the pup to Agoura Animal Care Center, where the German shepherd is receiving the care he needs to feel good again. Despite being abused and abandoned by his former caretaker, the rescued dog is friendly and affectionate, according to In Defense of Animals. The organization added that the dog, named Argon, is currently undergoing tests because the care center's staff is worried he may have lymphoma. The hikers essential to the dog's rescue told In Defense of Animals that Argon was sweet and gentle during their time together. They also informed the organization that they are committed to obtaining justice for the dog and finding him a new home. In Defense of Animals and Peace 4 Animals are helping with these goals by offering a reward for information about the individual who abandoned the dog. \"We are grateful for the quick actions of these hikers and law enforcement, but our efforts must continue,\" Fleur Dawes, the communications director of In Defense of Animals., said in a statement. \"This dog was left to suffer and die in a remote location. We urge anyone with information about this cruel act to come forward. We are determined to find the person responsible for this horrific abuse and hold them accountable since they are a danger to others.\" Animal lovers with information about this cruel incident are encouraged to contact In Defense of Animals at 415-879-6879.",

        "text": "For some viewers, it can be difficult to separate actors from the roles they convincingly play. Just ask Laura Leighton. Shortly after Melrose Place went off the air in 1999, Leighton and her husband, former costar Doug Savant, went to the hospital so the actor could get ankle surgery. Once a nurse entered the room, however, things went awry when she mistook Leighton for her character Sydney Andrews and Savant for his character Matt Fielding. \u201cI was in the hospital room with him [Doug] as he was preparing for surgery \u2014 or then recovering from surgery \u2014 and the nurse came in and was like, \u2018Why is she here?\u2019\u201d Leighton recently told PEOPLE. \u201cShe was really worried that I was going to do him harm. She was very confused on what was what. And she just had it in her mind that Sydney was there to hurt Matt in the hospital \u2026 That was funny and weird.\u201d Leighton, 55, portrayed Sydney for more than 125 episodes of Melrose Place, from 1993 to 1997 \u2014 a memorable run largely marked by mischief and mayhem onscreen. Savant\u2019s character Matt, meanwhile, was an openly gay man who, over the course of 160 episodes from 1992 to 1998, was the subject of physical assault and fired by his employer for his sexual orientation. He was eventually killed off in a car crash. But the reality for Leighton and Savant couldn\u2019t be further from the complex drama depicted on Melrose Place. The two married in 1998 after Savant, 60, realized he\u2019d found his soulmate.\u201cWe were friends on the set, but then it became, 'Oh my God, this person I think is so perfect is right here,\u2019\u201d Savant told PEOPLE in 2007. \u201cThe best thing that happened to me as a result of Melrose was meeting my wife.\u201d The couple, who share two children \u2014 Lucy and Jack \u2014 have since gone on to play other notable roles onscreen. Savant was a regular fixture on Desperate Housewives, playing Tom Scavo from 2004 to 2012. He has also appeared on 24, NCIS, The X-Files and 9-1-1. Leighton went on to play Ashley Marin on Pretty Little Liars from 2010 to 2018 and appeared on L.A.'s Finest, Dynasty and Fantasy Island, the last of which reunited her onscreen with former Melrose Place castmates Daphne Zuniga and Josie Bissett. She also recently teamed up with Zuniga and Courtney Thorne-Smith for the Melrose Place rewatch podcast entitled Still the Place. Produced by iHeartPodcasts, Still the Place will see the three actresses revisit the soapy primetime drama, reminiscing about each episode, sharing behind-the-scenes stories and hosting special guests that include the original cast and crew. For Leighton, the podcast is an opportunity to look back on a show that was a veritable pop culture phenomenon, landing the cast on magazine covers and inspiring viewing parties. It was unequivocally a \u201cspecial\u201d time, the actress acknowledges. \u201cI wish I could do the things we did then with my understanding now, because it was so much and we were so tired,\u201d she explains, adding, \u201cYou just want to be home. I would like to do those things now and realize how special it was.\u201d Never miss a story \u2014 sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer\u200b\u200b, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.

[+] following the UEFA EURO 2024 quarter-final match between England and Switzerland at Dusseldorf Arena on July 6, 2024 in Dusseldorf, Germany. (Photo by Jean Catuffe/Getty Images) Getty Images The 2024 Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) continent-wide championships, the quadrennial affair that, for some of Europe\u2019s soccer-mad soccer-heads, is somehow more accessible fun and more important than the World Cup, has brought a ton of drama to host-country Germany\u2019s stadiums this year. Christiano Ronaldo missed a \u201cgimme\u201d penalty and cried about it! France\u2019s Kylian Mbappe got a broken nose and now, busily doing his footie-magic thing in his special black onfield mask, looks something like a super-dashing love child of Batman and Leonardo from the Ninja Turtles! Mbappe\u2019s playing through the pain and hasn\u2019t actually been playing up to snuff \u2014 the new Real Madrid star awaits surgery at the end of the tourney \u2014 but off field he has been quietly stellar, wading in between games to appeal to his fellow countrymen the importance of avoiding Marine Le Pen at the polls! And, the French did just that. But none of that has quite measured up to the effervescent lifestyle debate triggered by the sprightly familial goings-on in the stands around Deutschland. Americans will require a primer on the social matrix in European soccer stadiums: When Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce\u2019s mom go to a Chiefs\u2019 game, they\u2019re usually discreetly seconded to an extremely expensive VIP skybox in whatever stadium. The point is that the couple\u2019s (burgeoning millions of) dyed-in-the-wool Swifties and Chiefs followers alike only receive super-grainy telephoto paparazzi shots of Swift and Momma Kelce jumping up and down and hugging each other each time Patrick Mahomes connects for a TD with Kelce. Kelce is, per force, down on the field or in the locker room. He doesn\u2019t pop up to the box say hi to his mom and girlfriend \u2014 instead, it\u2019s his brother who goes up there and screams and jumps around with his mom and Swift. Bottom line: thin photographic gruel for those fans. By contrast, in European football stadiums and specifically at the European championship, there\u2019s a homier and far less private architecture at work than that enjoyed by Taylor Swift and Mama Kelce. First, there are exactly zero skyboxes for the players\u2019 partners and/or wives and families. As the president of the British Football Association, Prince William will, of course, be in a box with other soccer bigwigs at any Euro event. But for the life partners and families of the players, there are discreet blocks of VIP/family seats in each stadium, which areas are well-policed but quite open and set intentionally low down on the field \u2014 meaning, unroofed and unglazed, thus highly accessible photographically. The reason these areas are set so low down at the field is that, post-match, the players can easily pop up from the field or the sidelines to visit their families in the stands. The result is a public relations agent\u2019s nail-biting nightmare, and the press know this, which makes the super-candid paparazzi imagery from the post-match family visitations all the more tasty and hungrily devoured by the faithful.

Put more brutally, it\u2019s a golden, tailor-made opportunity for the press to watch the immense pressures of the tournament and its necessary isolations at work on the players and their families \u2014 again, on those very internationally successful soccer players who are the most well-paid and famous athletic celebrities on the Continent. All fault lines within the familial relationships so displayed are exposed and pored over in the press. Each and every one. Added to the freight of those player visits to this part of the stands comes another fact: Week in and week out during the month-long tourney, the players live in the renowned athletes\u2019 bubble, largely inaccessible to their families. There may well occur family days, such as England\u2019s staged \u201cfamily days\u201d scheduled on the day after each game. But even those relatively well-handled tumbles have become somewhat difficult for the players and are, fascinatingly, being shortened, according to British captain Harry Kane. Second: Although a certain amount of \u201crule breakage\u201d of what follows will always inevitably occur, in general, player/partner conjugal visits are supposedly \u2014 at least sort-of, somewhat or mostly, take your pick \u2014 verboten during world-class tourneys. True is, any close contact with any people outside a given tournament bubble opens a host of psychological doors on the players that can affect performance on the field, although it must be quickly added that the jury is well out on this. In matters of abstinence, the working theory is that any complications brought by abstinence present less of a danger to the athletes\u2019 collective on-field performance than the complications carried by a lack of abstinence. Boy's Gotta Have His Lunch: Annie Kilner feeds her youngest son during the UEFA EURO 2024 round of ... [+] 16 match between England and Slovakia at Arena AufSchalke on June 30, 2024 in Gelsenkirchen, Germany. (Photo by Crystal Pix/MB Media/Getty Images) Getty Images Historically speaking, it can be argued that abstinence at any point of the day or night does not seem much on the mind of Britain\u2019s star international fullback and Manchester City stalwart Kyle Walker, whose youngest son with Kilner, who merrily arrived just last April, is pictured at top in his father\u2019s arms in the D\u00fcsseldorf stands on July 6, immediately after the British victory over Switzerland, which brought the team to their semifinal berth against the Netherlands. Pictured immediately above with his mother, Annie Kilner, in Gelsenkirchen, Bavaria, on June 30, this young fellow will, no doubt, have a fair number of paparazzi shots of him at various world-class soccer events to salt through his yearbook by the time he gets to university. And therein lies the tale of the social to-and-fro surrounding this European championship. In terms of international star-footballer lifestyle, and with four boys, one a newborn, the last weeks have not been easy for Annie Kilner, whom we should salute with all possible sympathy. Specifically, it\u2019s been difficult for her to leave her support network and decamp to Germany for the tournament month, unlike some of the other players\u2019 partners less freighted with newborn duties have done. So, as London\u2019s Fleet Street also endlessly chronicles, Kilner has been jetting in privately for each game with her burgeoning squad of boys in tow. Yes, it\u2019s not the most environmentally friendly method of doing the European championships, but private air does effectively get Kilner and the Walker/Kilner brood in and out of Deutschland with a lightning fast turnaround, and they spend the month more or less nesting at home. The impressive carbon tonnage they can offset later. All that noted, it\u2019s also a fact that Walker is as heroically productive off the field as he is on it. Put differently, the reasons that Kyle Walker and Annie Kilner are such constant and beloved targets of the London and the European press are many. Not the least of these reasons is Walker\u2019s staggering $11 million-plus per year salary at Manchester City under the fearsome Pep Guardiola, as well as Walker\u2019s range and intense productivity for the club and for his country in a stellar run of five Premier League championships since 2017. But along the way, off the field, Walker and Kilner have, also, earned a reputation as having a tempestuous marriage, and that proclivity for storm, though for the moment technically tamped down and just somewhat under wraps, is ongoing. Thus, Kilner\u2019s and Walker\u2019s joint appearances with their brood in the \u201cfamily visitation moments\u201d in the stands after England games has been under photographic scrutiny with an unmatched intensity. Some background is required: Kyle Walker is, also, the sire and paterfamilias of a different set of children who have been rather off the books until recently. During a 2020-21 break that Walker and Kilner took from their marriage, Walker fathered a son with British sometime-model-and-social-media-figure-about-town Lauryn Goodman. After that surprising joust, Walker and Kilner laboriously patched things up. And kudos to Kilner and her husband both for that. Within those bounds, matters seemed at least quiet-ish in the star footballer\u2019s private life, until mid-2023, when Walker was informed by Ms. Goodman that, in fact, a tryst they had had in London had resulted in a lovely second child, a daughter. According to the timing of the girl\u2019s birth, one only needed to count back to arrive at the notion that that tryst occurred at a point after Walker and Annie Kilner had patched things up following his first child with Goodman. Lauren Goodman held ranks for a while, but evenually, in the summer of 2023, she did finally break ranks and informed Walker and Annie Kilner, separately, and then the public, of the existence of her daughter and the incontrovertible issue of her paternity. Predictably, that threw the Walker/Kilner marriage into a renewed rocky period. Last January, three short months from delivering their fourth child, Kilner thossed Walker out of the house. On the field, Walker doubled down and helped Manchester City take the Premier League championship.

(Photo by Ricky Vigil /GC Images) GC Images Which brings us to the 2024 Euro championship, where, over the last weeks across Germany, all of the actors in this Shakespearean comedy have appeared on stage. Pictured above in April 2023, pregnant with her second child fathered by Walker, Goodman took this summer to prove that she is not the woman to stand by as large events involving the father of her two children, such as the European championships, occur. The close reader will notice that the habit of many players is to kit their offspring out with jerseys bearing their numbers and the legend \u201cDad,\u201d as Walker\u2019s and Kilner\u2019s boys are kitted out in the Frankfurt am Main stands after the Denmark game on June 20. Not to be outdone, it was arguably inevitable that Lauren Goodman mustered her Walker children into jerseys with Walker\u2019s iconic number 2 and the legend \u201cDaddy\u201d on the back and booked her family onto a plane to Germany as the tournament began in June. Long story short, the prospect of Walker\u2019s two families colliding, or even being present, at the (Denmark-England) game on June 20 was a bleeding nightmare for England\u2019s coach, Gareth Southgate, and for the team\u2019s upper management. As predictably, this was a total delight for the British press, and specifically for the tabloid Daily Mail, whose correspondents profiled and quoted Goodman liberally as they followed her to Germany and back. For their part, England\u2019s executives were forced to double down on their security detail for the \u201cfamily VIP\u201d stadium seats, and the balloon was floated with no doubt that the seating area would be off limits to Goodman and those two children of Walker\u2019s. In lifestyle-explosion sense, the Denmark game didn\u2019t provide the paparazzi with the fireworks their editors back in London were hoping for \u2014 Kilner and Walker stayed in the \u201cfamily-VIP\u201d section and Walker didn\u2019t visit his two children with Goodman, in a different section of the stands. That noted, as pictured in those stands on June 20, second from top, knowing that they were under what we might call clear and present danger, Annie Kilner and her husband do look pre-occupied, to put it diplomatically. The takeaway is two-fold. First, all is not as easy or as gilt as it may seem in the lives of those players or their families at the pinnacles of the globe\u2019s most popular sport. Second, we can tip the hat in salute to both Annie Kilner and Lauryn Goodman for taking the player\u2019s children resolutely to the championship games. Nominally separated from her husband and gossiped about to gargantuan proportions in the British press, Annie Kilner could easily excuse herself from showing up with any of her sons by Walker for any game, period. But she\u2019s made of sterner stuff. To date, she has resolutely appeared at each and every England contest literally before hundreds of thousands, a textbook execution of quite some power and grit when compared with other celebrities in potentially embarrassing circumstances. Her point is a simple one. Come what may, Kilner will have Walker pay fatherly obeisance to the weight of his paternal obligations. It will remain an extraordinary irony of Kyle Walker\u2019s already extraordinary on-field life that his former mistress Lauren Goodman is operating with exactly the same parameters. In a way, the European soccer championship shields Walker for the moment in a kind of hazy game-time truce. His concern \u2014 or more specifically and accurately \u2014 the great concern for his advisors and not least, his lawyers, will be what the two mothers of his six children decide to do with him after he plays England\u2019s last game.
